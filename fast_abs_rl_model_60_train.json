    "ref": "Virtually all PCs and monitors use the standard 'kettle' lead connector for power. Typically you'll need two power cables, one for the PC and one for the monitor. Some monitors, however, have an external power supply, so you won't plug the kettle lead directly into the monitor. The mic stand is compatible with all microphones. Put something that can absorb sound underneath the keyboard, like a thin foam mat. Sound travels along multiple paths, including some that reflect up to a microphone from a hard desk surface. The Shure SM57 is one of the most widely used mics for guitar amps, but some other favorites include Sennheiser's e609 Silver, e906, and MD 421 II; Audix's i5; Royer's R-121; Telefunken's M81; and the Neumann U 47 fet. Choosing the best universal microphone shock mount is interesting because most microphone brands offer their own compatible shock mounts that are designed to perfectly fit the microphone they are designed for. In some cases, they don't offer a compatible shock mount, which is a great reason to get a universal one. Phantom power, commonly designated as +48V or P48, was designed to power microphones without using bulky external power supplies such as the ones required for tube microphones. It's most widely used as a power source for condenser microphones, which have active electronics. Be sure to verify whether your microphone is a condenser type or another type such as dynamic or ribbon. If it is a condenser microphone it will need phantom power, if it is a different type of microphone it will not."

To attach the external flash extension cord, insert one end into the camera and the other end into the cold shoe where the flash sits. The purpose of the Flash Bracket is to prevent red eye by positioning the light above eye level.  Professional photographers do this using a detachable light held at arms length from above.

Waterproof means that they are impervious to water. Vetco recommends, as a general rule, not to connect more than three complete strips end-to-end without adding in extra, higher gauge power wire or additional power supply units down the line. Two of the most common remote control battery types include rechargeable lithium ion and alkaline batteries. These remote control batteries are easy to charge and minimize the need for purchasing replacement batteries. One remote can control multiple receivers. You need to match the code with each receiver by using a remote controller. First, hold the ON button for 5 seconds, then LED strips light will flash which means the remote has paired with the receiver successfully. The controller will remember all your data, including watering schedules, reports, and system settings. When the controller powers back on, it will automatically reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. Light dimmers save energy by reducing the flow of electricity to the bulb and allowing lights to operate with lower power outputs. Since lights under less stress shine longer, dimmers are known to extend the life span of your bulbs."

The pull cord can be purchased from a hardware store or garden and patio shop, while the tools needed are already in most households. You may need a light kit to install your fan. If you do not need a light kit, a switch housing cap will be inside the original Hunter box. Ceiling fans should be installed, or mounted, in the middle of the room and at least 7 feet above the floor and 18 inches from the walls. If ceiling height allows, install the fan 8 - 9 feet above the floor for optimal airflow. Most standard mount fans that hang from a down rod will put the blades about 12\" from the ceiling making them appropriate for rooms with ceilings that are 8 feet or higher. Flush mount fans are designed for rooms with low ceilings that are less than 8 feet.

This watch display box would most likely be able to hold pocket watches. The only catch  is you might have to remove the pillow or put the pocket watch under it. The product is the same dark brown color that is displayed in the picture. This makes it a great addition to any room. Each section of the display box is about 1 and a half inches wide. Some of today's huge watches can't be used with it."
