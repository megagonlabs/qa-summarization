    "ref": "Virtually all PCs and monitors use the standard 'kettle' lead connector for power. Typically you'll need two power cables, one for the PC and one for the monitor. Some monitors, however, have an external power supply, so you won't plug the kettle lead directly into the monitor. The mic stand is compatible with all microphones. Put something that can absorb sound underneath the keyboard, like a thin foam mat. Sound travels along multiple paths, including some that reflect up to a microphone from a hard desk surface. The Shure SM57 is one of the most widely used mics for guitar amps, but some other favorites include Sennheiser's e609 Silver, e906, and MD 421 II; Audix's i5; Royer's R-121; Telefunken's M81; and the Neumann U 47 fet. Choosing the best universal microphone shock mount is interesting because most microphone brands offer their own compatible shock mounts that are designed to perfectly fit the microphone they are designed for. In some cases, they don't offer a compatible shock mount, which is a great reason to get a universal one. Phantom power, commonly designated as +48V or P48, was designed to power microphones without using bulky external power supplies such as the ones required for tube microphones. It's most widely used as a power source for condenser microphones, which have active electronics. Be sure to verify whether your microphone is a condenser type or another type such as dynamic or ribbon. If it is a condenser microphone it will need phantom power, if it is a different type of microphone it will not."

It is also water-repellent which means it is not easily penetrated by water, especially as a result of being treated for such a purpose with a surface coating. Waterproof means that they are impervious to water. Vetco recommends, as a general rule, not to connect more than three complete strips end-to-end without adding in extra, higher gauge power wire or additional power supply units down the line. Two of the most common remote control battery types include rechargeable lithium ion and alkaline batteries. These remote control batteries are easy to charge and minimize the need for purchasing replacement batteries. One remote can control multiple receivers. You need to match the code with each receiver by using a remote controller. First, hold the ON button for 5 seconds, then LED strips light will flash which means the remote has paired with the receiver successfully. The controller will remember all your data, including watering schedules, reports, and system settings. When the controller powers back on, it will automatically reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. Light dimmers save energy by reducing the flow of electricity to the bulb and allowing lights to operate with lower power outputs. Since lights under less stress shine longer, dimmers are known to extend the life span of your bulbs."

If you do not need a light kit, a switch housing cap will be inside the original Hunter box. Ceiling fans should be installed, or mounted, in the middle of the room and at least 7 feet above the floor and 18 inches from the walls. If ceiling height allows, install the fan 8 - 9 feet above the floor for optimal airflow. Most standard mount fans that hang from a down rod will put the blades about 12\" from the ceiling making them appropriate for rooms with ceilings that are 8 feet or higher. Flush mount fans are designed for rooms with low ceilings that are less than 8 feet.

Most cars have power flowing to the cigarette lighter. A one hundred Ah battery will last up to 20 hours if the cooler draws its maximum of 5.0 amps. Watts is 5 amps at 12 volts, so using the standard formula P=EI, wattage is 60. The P65 model has a heat function that is similar to the P27, you simply have to flip over the connector to heat.Meat is kept as cool as it would if it were in a standard refrigerator. If unplugged overnight, it is recommended that you have ice packs in the cooler and a blanket on top of the lid for insulation, and your food will stay cold and fresh for the next day."

This product can work with the NexStar 130 for viewing of the Moon. It would be hard to see other planets unless you change the focal length. This product is for use with a Windows system. A Mac would need a different product than this one for ideal use. This product is threaded on both ends so that you can put them on both ends with a 1.25\" adapter compatible with any telescope that you would like to use them on. This product would work with a Windows 7 but wouldn't work with Linux. This product can be used ideally with a large telescope but with a smaller optic you would have a lot of feedback that would interfere with results. This product can be used with 2x or 3x to get higher magnification but it would be more difficult to keep centered and in focus unless you are very skilled. This product comes standard with a 1.25\" barrel that can be used with any 1.25\" eyepiece, which includes the Nexstar130 SLT without an adapter."
