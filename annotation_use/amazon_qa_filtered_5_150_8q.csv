There's not really any historical/educational benefit to the game other than the use of the 7 wonders and some historically flavored cards used in the game. It's a great game, but not educational."
Toys_and_Games,B0043KJW5M,"Is there any witchcraft, curses, etc in this game?","No. The premise of the game is to build up the empire of an ancient civilization. No magic, witchcraft or supernatural stuff."
Toys_and_Games,B0043KJW5M,Any reason this game would be inappropriate for experienced game players age 8 & 10?,Nope. Good interactive game-play. The artwork shows some men in gladiator garb and men and women in modest togas.

Toys_and_Games,B0043KJW5M,"Card sleeve size This game is getting a lot of play, especially the 3 - 5 player cards. It would be nice to sleeve them, does anyone know what size sleeves these need?","The best sleeves are from Ultra Pro (http://amzn.com/B005CM80X0). The sleeves from Mayday Games are thinner, so they split easily if you try to shuffle the cards. Worse, the Mayday sleeves STICK to each other and you really have to double-check the cards when you sort them after a game. The Ultra Pro sleeves don't split and they don't stick. The only downside with the Ultra Pro sleeves is that they're a little bigger, so the cards don't easily fit in the storage slots in the box. They DO fit, but it's tight."
Toys_and_Games,B0043KJW5M,Sounds like the rules are poorly written.  What's the best way to get a better set of rules so you start on the right foot?,"See the following video on You tube: ""7 Wonders Demo - BoardGameGeek Booth - Essen Spiel 2010"""

Toys_and_Games,B009NFFYWM,"The manufacturer states this is suitable for 2 years old, but the note on the information states not suitable for 2 year old because of choking hazard. please advise.","The only choking hazard with this tank engine is if the toy is unscrewed, and then pulled apart, and the Battery is taken out and swallowed.I don't see this as a choking hazard with normal use."
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,Do these batteries work for the fc40?,Yes those will work in a phantom fc40
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,how much does it weigh?,"That depends entirely on how much you choose to load it down. The Phantom (including battery) weighs about 800 grams (28.2 oz). If you load it with a ZenMuse gimbal, a GoPro, and an FPV transmitter, you're adding about another 400 - 500 grams to that, bringing the overall weight to 1,200 - 1,300 grams (42.3 - 45.9 oz)."
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,"How long will the dji phantom fly with standard battery, and is extended flight possible with larger batt ?","You will get anywhere from 10 to 12 minutes on this battery if your Phantom is left stock and your camera is mounted on the Phantom housing. Wind conditions and the way you fly are also contributing factors to battery life. The battery compartment will restrict you from getting anything much bigger. Many people have made modifications to the Phantom to use bigger batteries and even multiple batteries but remember that the more weight you add to the copter, the more the engines have to work. So often times these modifications will demand more power. Hope this helps..."
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,"Hi, will this battery fit fine in DJI Phantom?",Yes. Fits version 1 and those variations. Does NOT fit version 2 or Vision Phantoms. Perfect fit for Phantom 1's. Easy to put battery in and shove in cables.
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,Are these OEM brand? Or knock offs?,Oem - those batteries come with the phantom inside the box.
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,this works for dji phantom fc40 right ?,It sure does.  Exact replacement.
Toys_and_Games,B00CS825XM,when i buy the FC 40 does the battery comes with the charger?,"DJI does include a battery charger with the Fc 40 phantom.

Thank You!,"Took about 30 mins to install and there is a spot on mount and the handle that allows you to install a lock so the handle can not be turned to remove the spare.

Automotive,B002RWK9LY,22OV 60HZ MODEL? WILL BUY. THANKS,"It has (2) 110V AC and (1) 12V DC. You will need higher wattage for 220. Decide if you need the quite and electronic controlled voltage output (such as needed for running computers,  sensitive equipment, etc). If not, you can buy cheaper standard generators with 220V outlets. Definitely stick to 4 cycle equipment rather than 2 cycle which requires a gas/oil mix."

This is a 1000 watt generator--about 8 amps of power. any motor that draws more than 8 amps starting current would be too much load.
Automotive,B002RWK9LY,does it have overcharge protection when charging a 12v deep dischage battery,"No, it is an inverter/generator not a battery charger."

Electronics,B006ZN4VE2,will this work on the celestron nexstar 130 gt,It will work on the NexStar 130 GT but mainly for the Moon. The focal length is 650mm so Jupiter and other planets will be small. You can use a 2x to 3x Barlow though to double or triple your focal length. Then the main issue becomes how well does the scope track. With the small field of view that you get with this camera it is hard to find and keep the planet in sight. You can ask your question at Cloudy Nights and get many more people trying to help you.

Electronics,B006ZN4VE2,Can it be used with an eyepiece to image at a greater power or can it only be used at the prime focus?,It can be used with a 2x or 3x barlow to get higher magnification of the planets. May be harder to focus and harder to keep the image centered unless you have good tracking.  Experiment! Ernest.
Electronics,B006ZN4VE2,will work with NexStar 130 SLT Computerized Telescope? Will need any adaptor (or advised to have?) thanks,"This camera is equipped with a 1.25"" barrel so that it will work in place of any 1.25"" eyepiece.

Just search Amazon. Get the installation kit for the 2004 Toyota Corolla, and the wire adapter kit for the Boss to Toyota. The wire kit is optional, but makes it easier to connect the Boss to the Toyota harness. Look for something like the the Metra wiring harness for 2004 Toyota cars.

It might be a bit funky looking to tilt and rotate camera at the same time though...
Electronics,B00AB2EN2I,"Is there an option to run for the full hour, but only rotate a certain degree? i.e. 90 degrees in 60 minutes, or 157 degrees in 30 minutes?","The device is pretty straight forward. It essentially works like an egg timer so the degree per time would be fixed. The side has markings in 15 minute increments with a set degree for that time ie. 15min/90 degrees, 30min/180 degrees, 45min/270 degrees and 60min/360 degrees. You could go in between those markings but you would be guessing at that. Hope this helps."

Electronics,B003V1YGSW,Is this grey market?  What warranty does it have?,"Bought it new, made in Japan, with 2 years TOKINA Warranty Service."
Electronics,B003V1YGSW,Does anyone use this lens with Nikon D800? Can yo share your experience?,"It works great with the Nikon D800. Nice and sharp in the middle, a little bit of softness along the corners but thats normal with a wide-angle.  Just be careful with this lens since the aperture lever is prone to being bent by an impact since it sticks out."
Electronics,B003V1YGSW,Will this work on the Nikon D3100?,"It will work, but you will not receive the full benefit from it. This lens is made for a full frame (FX) camera and the D3100 is a crop frame camera. It will be like putting a 24-42mm lens on the D3100. You need to use a lens designated as DX for this camera. A better choice would be a DX lens that is something like 10-xx mm if you want something super wide."
Electronics,B003V1YGSW,is lens cap as same as in picture? or is a click-on cap?,"The cap comes over and around the hood. It clicks in place. Is not the traditional flat click cover, as this lens has a curved lens. Is like a cup that is place over the lens itself. Hope it helps!"
Electronics,B003V1YGSW,Does this work for the Nikon D300?,This should work on a nikon D300 however i do not recommend it if you're not planning to buy a full frame camera. You might be better off with tokina 11-16 for d300. It is wider and cheaper and smaller. However the 11-16 won't work with full frame cameras.
Electronics,B003V1YGSW,Is there any kind of adapter that would let you use filters with this lens?,"There are a couple external devices available, that attach over the Lens hood. They are pretty pricey. Check with B&H; Photo"

Electronics,B0046WZ08U,How long is the IR reciever cable?,"from what i recall,it is about 6-6 feet...but you can splice cat5 wire to make it any length you need...i use the twisted pairs(i.e green pair,orange pair and blue pair)..orange for 12volt,green for ground,and blue for ir signal)...."
Electronics,B0046WZ08U,"Receiver size: Part II  see answers to previous ? about this. Some say a small light, 1 said the ""whole piece"" lites when remote pushed Which is it?","A small red LED lites, not the entire sensor."

Electronics,B0046WZ08U,does anyone know what kind of emitter this comes with?,It comes with 4 IR emitters.
Electronics,B0046WZ08U,Is there any type of delay with this .... when you press a button on the remote and it is registered with the device?,No. Works great. Well worth the money
Electronics,B0046WZ08U,Will it control a Bluray and audio receiver? Thanks.,"Yes, absolutely.  IR is the standard ""remote"" technology and it's inconceivable that one of your units wouldn't have it.  The Xantech simply receives all IR signals sent from your remotes and passes them along to the individual units - e.g. your BluRay player and audio receiver - through the little stick-on transmitters."
Electronics,B004CIPPRO,Is this a DIgital/Trunking Scanner?  Will it do P-25?,Yes it is a digital scanner. Yes it does pickup P25 crystal clear.  Very good scanner.

Electronics,B004S7W1RQ,could this work with any lens with the correct filter size?,"Hello, Kevin only fit in a few lenses the 14-42, 14-150 and 40-150"
Electronics,B004S7W1RQ,Can you put a filter over this converter?,"Short answer; It does NOT have threads to screw on a filter.To put a filter on/in front of, you would need a different (suggest) holder apart from the lens, that would accept filter plates to slide in/out."
Electronics,B004S7W1RQ,"WIll this work with the Panasonic Lesns with manual zoom?  i have the 14-42mm, 14-140mm and the 50-200mm panasonic lens.","No, it uses a special type of connector that will only work on certain Olympus lenses."
Electronics,B004S7W1RQ,"The bayonet mounting is very loose.  Does it snap into position, or is there a workaround better than taping the threads?",It's suppose to twist lock into position nice and snug.
Electronics,B005NHTG6O,Will it hold a samsung tablet with ease and safely?,"If it is the same size and weight as an iPad or smaller, it should be okay."

Electronics,B005NHTG6O,will it also hold an actual book as in a cookbook?,"it can hold a medium size cookbook, if it isn't too heavy or too bulky. of course, it cannot hold open the pages, so you need something to hold the page. i would consider it twice before putting any book on it. standing up, a very thin book can be inserted into the slot. for books i rather use a special stand."
Electronics,B005NHTG6O,Does the Wand actually float above the holder for it?,The wand has its own little rubber stand to put where you want it.
Electronics,B005NHTG6O,Will this work with a Otter Box case?,"If you're concerned with the size of the opening that a phone or tablet would rest in, it would need to be no thicker than 5/8""."

Electronics,B005POPRG8,Just checking. This mobo is compatible with the AMD FX-9590 right?,Asrock doesn't list that CPU as supported on their website. http://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/970%20Extreme3/?cat=CPU It might not be supported because of the high wattage on that CPU (220W). Other FX models that are 125W and 95W are supported though with a bios update.*edit* Actually looking under specifications this motherboard is only rated up to 140W so you would need a lower powered CPU for this motherboard. http://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/970%20Extreme3/?cat=Specifications

Electronics,B00843ERMW,Is this compatible with the Blackmagic pocket cinema camera,"Once again, the Blackmagic camera should work.  Another responder indicated that it won't focus or operate the iris because it doesn't make electrical connections between the lens and the camera.  The Blackmagic web site says, ""Blackbagic Pocket Cinema Camera features an active MFT lend mount and high resolution 3.5"" LCD.""  The reference to ""active lens mount"" is with respect to the active electrical connections and ability to focus and operate the iris."
Electronics,B00843ERMW,What's the maximum fov of this lens at it's widest angle? i'd like to achieve a fisheye effect like the gopro camera's wide angle.,"The lense's widest focal length is 12mm. This is a MFT lens, so there is a cropping factor to take into consideration. On most mft cameras. 12mm is equivalent to a 24mm FOV, so it doesn't look fisheye. You'll need something like a 7mm to achieve that affect. With that said, this is an INCREDIBLE lens. Excellent for both cinematography and photography."
Electronics,B00843ERMW,Does this lens from Amazon come with a rear and front lens cap as well as a lens storage bag like it does on B&H?,"Yes, the same lens.RegardsJuan"
Electronics,B00843ERMW,When buying this lens on here (Amazon) does it come with the front and rear lens caps and lens storage bag?,Yes. It is more of a lens pouch with pad at bottom and synthetic material construction with drawstring.

Electronics,B00A49UH2S,"The title seems to claim this will *reset* airbag codes. Is that true? It's disturbing that so many people claim it does not, and none claim it does.","The answer to that question is Yes, technically.  The way older VW/Audi cars work is that once a code is thrown (and the light comes on) it has to be manually reset in order to remove it and turn the light off (i.e., simply fixing the issue will not automatically make the light go away on its own).  That written, if there is a problem detected that results in the light coming on you cannot use this device to simply 'make the light go away' without addressing the problem."

Electronics,B00CFX58YI,"what is the best pioneer 12"" subwoofer would anyone recommend to run on this amp?","Really depends on a slew of other factors: Size restrictions, box size, venting/porting.

Electronics,B00D18U6K2,Is this case real leather or synthetic?,"Frankly, it is a little of both. There is indeed some real leather in it, but it is blended.

It's also strong enough to hold it shut when your hand is holding the iPad upside down by the spine.  Random things get attached to the iPad cover because of the magnet.  However, if the iPad cover slips and the edge of the iPad is exposed, then the magnet will no longer hold the cover shut."
Electronics,B00GDAGKNM,"Does this cover both the front and the back of the iPad air ?  From the picture, it looks like this only covers the front of the ipad","Yes, it covers front and back."

You have to make sure both are all the way up to be able to hear audio through the speakers."
Electronics,B00GX9A06Q,Does this work as a speaker for the desk? Can it be plugged in and just remain there? Does it sound good enough for that?,"It doesnt need to be plugged in because of the great battery life, but yes it is good enough. It can easily cover a medium sized room. It uses a micro USB port to charge. If you like deep bass, this is not the speaker for you. But if you enjoy other music, it has great quality for the price."

These are small and light binoculars, and the downside to the smaller size is a smaller field of vision and the need to adjust the width to an absolutely precise distance between your eyes, otherwise you won't be able to see through both lenses at once.

Electronics,B000HCN0RG,Is this good for a Canon 40D?,"OK, the answer is, any camera for which you can buy a T adapter, will work with this lens. If you can get a Canon T adapter, then the chances are 99% that it will work with any Canon camera. BUT since there is NO autofocus coupling, NO exposure coupling, the lens is a preset lens (look it up), you have to know how to use your camera on manual for your particular camera.

It seems to work only on the 2.0.,"USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 are completely backwards compatible, so if it operates off of USB2.0 technology and you plug it into a USB3.0 port, it'll work just as if that port was 2.0. So, if you're having issues with it working in the 3.0 Port the issue may be the port itself, not the headset.Try finding a 3.0 device (like a flash drive) and trying that, if it works try another 2.0 device besides the headset. If all else fails force an update on the drivers."

But one thing Sony warns about is overheating if used too long at a time.Be sure to use a class 10 memory card for fastest transfers.
Electronics,B006K551TO,is this camera a dlsr,"Since it has both an LCD and an eye viewer, it functions as a DSLR. However, since it is electronic, the image in the viewfinder may or may not result from a prism. Instead, it may be an electronic image.

Electronics,B00A1ZU1I0,This is probably a really dumb set of questions: 1) does the front fan for intake or exhaust? 2) does the stock fan work well or get a replacement?,"By default the front fan is intake like any other case.  Always put intake in front, exhaust in back/on top.  You could flip the fan around if you wanted to make it an exhaust but that would be crazy.  The stock fan works fine, it's a Silverstone branded 120mm fan that spins around 1100-1200RPM, just enough to be nearly silent.  If you want more intake from the front, buy an 80mm fan (1400-1700RPM would be good) and install it below the 120mm fan with the four mounting screws that come with any new fan -- there is a cut-out for one there."

It would work just mediocre on receive (almost any antenna of 50-ohm can be used for receiving, it's just a matter of how well it will work), but would not work properly on transmit and would likely burn out your finals in the radio if you tried to use it for transmitting after a few minutes (too much power would be reflected back into the radio).

In most water softeners all three steps discharge liquid through the same tube. The second step is the problem.  If you use sodium chloride to recharge the resin cartridge the concentrated salt water will be discharged into the ground. You could switch to potassium chloride which is more expensive but less harmful to ground water."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UV0F9U,Does this manometer measure flue pressure and home pressure with reference to the outdoors of a home.  will it do what a dg 700 manometer does.,"Well it will measure 2 different pressures at the same time. It will then give you the differential in real time. You have to toggle it  to see each pressure. It does not show each pressure at the same time. You would run your tubing to whatever place you want to reference pressure. The Dg 700 you referenced is for serious building pressure and tightness testing. This meter is great for reading pressures 1 to 60 inches. The Dg 700  meter is probably good for the low end. Below 1""  and a second higher range. Flue pressures are usually below 1"" also"

Anyone try installing UNDERmount? Looks like that would be possible, since in the photo, the top of sink is flat.  (Even if top had some embossed ridges, those could be shimmed around.) The question of topmount or undermount is mostly a question of labor costs.  The vendor does not want to disappoint the customer with extra install costs. Those who are DIY hobbyists, won't mind the extra time."

Because it does not have a full tang, after only a few throws (hits and misses), the blade head loosens slightly from the handle and will in time become even more loose.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B002EQEE82,Does this work well for pasti dip?,"It snaps on to a standard size spray paint can, and when you pull the handle it just pushes a little plastic ""finger"" down onto the nozzle. So if your plasti dip is in a spray paint size can, it will work exactly the same as holding the nozzle down with your finger. it just gives you slightly better control over how hard you spray and whatnot, but it uses the original can's nozzle."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B002EQEE82,Does this product feel flimsy?  Is it well made or just cheap plastic?,"Product is substantial enough but only works on the ""button"" type paint can, not on the shaped type can."

Not sure about the gauge of the wire. The power pack is made to handle the 4 fixtures that come with it. Any more fixtures may draw more power than the pack can handle and possibly dimming the lights. The set works very well when installed as directed.

If the electric source is 220, how are you going to break apart the permanently molded three output, three prong 110 female connector on the cable you want to use, to 110 volt use? You could be getting 220 at the output illegally unless you butcher up the molded output connector and break out 110 volt leads. Harry McDiarmid 631 277-8734"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B005Z17WLE,Do these outlets work with standard 3 prong or 2 prong cords?,The generator side is a twist lock 220 volt plug and it taps out to four standard 110v outlets that will work with standard two or three pronged plugs. so YES.

Musical_Instruments,B004PKCH0M,will this pedal work with Yamaha YPG-235 76-Key Portable Grand Piano??...plz i need to know :/ NEED ANSWERS ASAP! thank you,"Anne Bothman is right. Unless your on a Casio keyboard, Casio pedals usually work in reverse of how  supposed to work, because of the polarity. (it will hold when you let go of the pedal, and the sound stops when you press on it. it's supposed to work the other way).  Most other brands do not have this problem, but your best bet is to get a Yamaha pedal, just in case. That way you will know for sure it's compatible."

Musical_Instruments,B001U0OWSU,Does this guitar have a steel reinforced neck?,"No, most nylon string guitars do not use a truss rod in the neck and the HC06 is no exeption.

You can warp or twist a nylon string neck if using incorrect stringing methods."
Musical_Instruments,B001U0OWSU,Is this easier on your fingers---is there a marked differences in the callouses and pain compared to steel strings,"Yes, nylon strings are MUCH easier on the fingers.  The strings are also farther apart, which can be good if you do not have small fingers."

Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does it sound good played both acoustically and amplified?,"It sounds very good acoustically for a thin-line guitar. Since it has a thin body, you wont get the deep bass sound that you get from a standard size acoustic guitar. Plugged in directly to an amp it doesn't sound that great, however, you can get a very nice amplified sound by either: 1) installing an ACTIVE pickup that you can find online for around ten bucks, or 2) playing through an effects pedal that has EQ, Chorus, etc. An effects pedal gives you more control of the sound."
Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does this have Active Electronics?,"No, this guitar has ""passive"" electronics.. There are only two slider switches for the pickup, master volume , and a master tone .. It's passive because there are no batteries required, there is no ""pre-amp"" .. Very simple , when plugged into your amp that's all you get, it sounds great with the E,A,D,and G strings when your playing... However the tone for the B,and high E strings is very very weak ..even when your tone switch is maxed out on the guitar... Over all it's good for what is is... Hope this helps !"

If you push down hard enough the top won't rotate unless you try to make it do so. If you set it onto the pole and grab the edge and turn, it will rotate. Also, no way to lock the top on, so if you pick the table up, the top can literally pop off the pole and base.

It's hard to tell from the photo whether they are the steak knives sold on Amazon 4 for $50/8 for $90 or cheaper versi","Yes, these are the classic steak knives with a fine serration.

Home_and_Kitchen,B00CIVRA3E,Do they rust after a period of time?,Not so far. Only disappointment is that the steak knives were stamped steel unlike the rest of the set that was forged. Kind of misleading when the set is advertised as forged.

Home_and_Kitchen,B00DJA5W9C,About how much is dispensed with one pump?,It really depends on the type of liquid you place in the pump. Thinner liquids will dispense slightly more than thicker.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00DJA5W9C,Someone mentioned that they had stickers on them that they weren't even going to try to get off. Did you have this problem? How did you solve it?,The picture is deceptive.  It looks blue but it is clear and of very poor quality.  Like something you would get in a dollar store.

Home_and_Kitchen,B00EUAH58G,are the 8 gram Co2 cartridges universal?,Mosa 8gm are too long and will NOT fit it.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00EUAH58G,Can you carbonate any liquid such as orange juice or wine?,"Go on utube.  Juices are too thick unless you water it down.  Wines does work, but only half bottle because of all the fizz it creates.  Manufactures do not recommend it."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00EUAH58G,"How is this different from ""SodaStream Fountain Jet Home Soda Maker Starter Kit""? This is over 3 times cheaper.","Yes, but they are very expensive and much bigger. Soda Stream is a big commitment.It's not cost efficient to throw them out and buy brand new ones.Frankly, i have a bunch of different soda makers and the best by far is the old fashioned bottle that you charge and shake --like from old time movies where they'd add a spritz to some hard liquor.  They are like $35 but last forever and the chargers are just pennies per liter."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00EUAH58G,Does this fit the SodaStream 1L bottles?,"No! The top of the bottle has notches to lock. You can make it in the bottle that comes with it, then pour it into the soda stream bottle."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00EUAH58G,"Does the 1L bottle include a cap to store the made soda, or does it have to be consumed at the time you carbonate it? =)",There is an airtight cap so the soda remains as in a siphon and retains the gas. However it is best to consume it with 24 hours.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00EUAH58G,The user manual mentioned the possibility to add flavored syrup to the water in the bottle. Does the bottle also support adding natural lemon juice or it c,"You can add pretty much anything you want to the bottle.  If you want to make 'sodas', you put in some water, and the flavoring.  Lemon juice works fine.  Pretty much anything you can blow bubbles through works."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,how do you clean the jets,The manual has cleaning instructions using white vinegar but too many steps for this venue.  Suggest you either go to the manufacture's web site or call them for detailed instructions.  It's a simple process just too much to type here.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,How long does it take to make a full pot?  Is it quicker if you make a smaller amount?,Same time as an auto drip.  Less time for smaller amounts vs full pot
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,i would like to hear more abou tthe silt or sludge comments i have read in some of the reviews?,"The 'in carafe' filter basket removes almost, but not all, of the sediment. Part of the appeal of this method of brewing is the fact paper filters are not removing these fine particles. There are health benefits to this method as well as maximizing the flavor throughout the entire process. One person below pours out the last half cup of the pot - the sensible remedy for this. Keep in mind no paper filters are harmed this way."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,What grind is used?,"Dear Kaye,Fresh, medium coarse to coarsely ground coffee is recommended for best results.DianeCustomer Care"
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,How much of icoffee is made of plastic?,"All except the container/pot and warming plate. Can't say about internals. This is made the same as most any Wal Mart/Target brand (it has the Remington brand name on the base) only it has the swirl function. The strainer/filter is metal but not big whoop there. Again, if want to save yourself a $100.00 go but a upscale Mr. Coffee and forget all the hype around Icoffee."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,Does this coffee maker have an auto shutoff for the warming plate.,Yes it does.   After 2 hours
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,Can you brew less than 4 cups?,"yes, put in just enough coffee and water and you can brew a single cup"
Home_and_Kitchen,B00F67PZIY,Can you turn off the Mozart Theme?,"Yes...when not brewing, press the ""minutes/music"" button..second touch should see on/off selection..."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,How does this pan compare to the 4112?  Description sounds very similar but this price is much lower (with a lid.)  Just because of sale?,The lid is the only difference.  The one with lid is just a special sale price.

Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,Can this pan go under the broiler for five or so minutes?,"""Oven safe up to 500 degrees F.  Do not use under broiler"""
Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,Why such a hard time cleaning this pan?!  Just bought.  First All-Clad.  But sticking and staining. Even with Barkeep's Friend.  Please help.  Thx!,Did you use a cooking spray on it before you used it. That's not good. It can cause stains that are very difficult to remove and clean. A scouring pad should do the job with some soap. Barkeep's Friend should certainly help. If all fails use an SOS pad.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,how hot can the oven be for this pan?  it doesn't say anything anywhere,Oven safe up 500 degreed.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,"Does this have a non stick coating? On their website it says ""All-Clad's durable, PFOA-free nonstick coating provides effortless clean-up"".","No, this pan has an all stainless-steel interior. They do sell non-stick pans but this model isn't one of them."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,Are all All-Clad cookware items three ply?,No. The Copper Clad is Two Ply.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00FUF5K8W,can i use this pan on an induction heating element??,Yes.  This item is induction compatible.
Home_and_Kitchen,B00HBDMW1Y,What type of bags does it take?,"It takes type O bags, but you can put in type U.  Type O are the cloth HEPA bags and type U are standard paper bags."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00HBDMW1Y,Is it self propelled?,"If you mean like a Roomba, no. If you mean does it have enough power that you just push it (most of the time) without feeling its weight--then yes."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00HBDMW1Y,how long is the hose with the telescoping wand attached?,hose and wand and crevice attachment are at least 8 feet long
Home_and_Kitchen,B00HBDMW1Y,The internet ratings clearly indicate a discontent with the length of the tools hose.  Is there a extensioin hose available anywhere?  Details please.,"The flexible hose is just a few feet long and the extension which comes with the cleaner is 30 or 36 inches long. So, you can use this vacuum to clean sofas and in and around furniture and tables. But, not to vacuum anything which is more than 4 or 5 feet from the floor."
Home_and_Kitchen,B00HBDMW1Y,"Is this a Bypass, Direct, or Tandem Air Vacuum design? Thanks!","Whatever it is, it sucks.  Which is cool."

Home_and_Kitchen,B00HBDMW1Y,Does the vacuum listed as used have a warranty ?,If it is from Sears it should have a Warranty if not pass. The Vaccuum only costed $169

You can feed this sub panel with 60 amps and determine which load you want to use. iE if you have 3 refrigerators and 1 freezer, you can cycle then without moving wires from one panel to another. Just do some load shedding in an event of an emergency. Easier to turn breakers on and off then to move wires around."

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0006GT6C6,"Does anyone have experience using this on a hillside?  Specifically, will this work on a 45-degree sloped hillside?","If you are using a Treegator® Original bag on a sloped surface, make sure that the zippers are on the uphill side of the slope. This will allow the bag to drain properly every time it is filled. If you are using the product on a slope greater than 25 top 30 degrees, you definitely want to make sure that the planting is properly staked, and ensure that the bag will not be too heavy when leaning on the trunk (particularly when using on trees from 1 to 2 inches in trunk diameter)"

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0006GT6C6,"Why it it a problem  if the base of the tree is less that 2""?

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000PWD6SQ,"It says ""push the trigger.""  Do you have to hold it or is it an on/off switch?",On/off. Just push and release and your bug gets sucked into the machine
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000PWD6SQ,"If no battery, how does it get its power?","It uses suction. There's a compartment at the bottom you push in to create pressure, then the compartment is released when you press the button, drawing in air quickly."
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000PWD6SQ,"Once the insect has been sucked up into the BugZooka, what prevents it from crawling out?","There is a trap door that is opened with suction but closes and traps the bug in the chamber at the end of the wand. To release the bug, remove the chamber and tip the bug out."
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000PWD6SQ,Can it pick up multiple bugs at a time?,Not unless they are ontop of each other. It uses a short burst of vacuumed air from compressing the chamber. One bug at a time and ideally ones which are not moving as the top is small and narrow. You won't be emptying out a bee hive with it.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000PWD6SQ,Will it pick up 5 to 6 inch centipedes?,"Anything larger than a stinkbug will not fit. It will tear up any bug that is delicate, like a moth. It is more made for beetles, small bees, small spiders, stinkbugs, etc. Any bug longer or larger than the diameter of the circle that sucks the bugs in will be damaged by the forceful suction. That defeats the purpose of the product to get bugs outside alive."
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001ACPOIA,is this water soluble?,"yes, but not as soluble as say sugar;it is in the form of pellets 2x the size of apple seeds and it takes some time to dissolve. It does wonders for the roots of plants if used in the spring. Highly recommended"
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B001ACPOIA,"What is this refined from? How is it refined? Also, does this require 15x less for the same amount of available Phosphates as 0-3-0 Pock Phosphate?",Gardening is hit n miss.  WHY do you think you need Phosphate???  If you have consulted your local nursery n they told you to use Triple phosphate THEY should know.  The ultimate answer is in the results of actually using the phosphate to see what your plants need.  THAT IS HOW GARDENING WORKS....TREAT A SMALL AREA N SEE WHAT RESULTS YOU GET.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,Please confirm this item can be fitted to Glock 35 ?  And rear sight with both windage and elevation adjustment  ?,"All dovetails are created pretty much the same so it will fit. However, if you're attempting this on your own keep a dremel with a grinder bit handy. It takes a steady hand to fit it properly. As well, invest in the upper vice with site tool, works better than attempting to use a punch set and wont damage the sight either. It is adjustable with a third screw hole that will lock the sight adjustments. Front blade is higher set than most and may require shaving for fit in some holsters. Hope that helps."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,Will these fit a Glock 42?,"No- it would be silly, sort of like putting a sniper scope on your skeet gun..  You could do it , but this is not really the sites you want for this."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,Will this fit a gen 4 glock 27?,"The Meprolight.com website, which you can visit yourself, says that different sight sets are ""meant"" for the G26 & G27, because those dedicated sights are considered ""snag free"" for concealed carry of those sub-compacts. Just because this adjustable sight set is not ""meant"" for the sub-compact G26 & G27 doesn't mean it won't fit them though."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,Can this be used on a Gen 2 Glock 19?,"Yes, glock uses the same attachment method for the front sight and the same size dovetail for the rear on all their guns, regardless of caliber or generation. May shoot a little high at first as this is a model for .45/10mm which just means the front sight blade is SLIGHTLY taller."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,"since it sounds like the front sight is quite a bit taller, would you still recommend it for ccw with bigger holster or a home defense sight?","You are right about the front sight being larger, so if you plan to holster it, you will need a larger holster.  The thing that sets this sight apart is that it is adjustable.  For many shooters, that's critical because they consistently pull the pistol to the right or left when they pull the trigger.  It is a great sight for home defense."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,would this product be considered the meprolite green variety???,"Yes, highly visible and adjustable."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000VYW1XY,will this work with G30 gen 4?,Works on gen 4 g35

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0014VVXLY,Does anyone know if this will fit the hi point c9?,This is what you need... Fobus Standard Holster RH Paddle HP2 Hi-Point 9MM & 380
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0014VVXLY,WILL THIS FIT SR45?,"The Fobus Standard Holster RH should fit the SR45.  It has an adjustable screw to loosen or tighten the fit of the gun.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001L7YC2I,how long is the handle,About 6 to 7 inches. The handle has length. But the blade is not well balanced with the handle. But still a nicely made sword
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001L7YC2I,"is this sword able to be taken apart, or is the blade glued into the handle?",It can be taken apart. It has a wooden handle with a wooden sheath. The sheath is very tight fitting when you first take the sword out of it
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001Q72ARC,What is the rubber gasket for? Where does it go?,the gasket slides down the length of the  blade  to secure Quillons (hand guard) to the hilt. so far the additional support was worked well even in full contact.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001Q72ARC,Would this be allowed at a con?,"Very doubtful. This is a full contact training implement, and would be most likely considered in the same category as a Bokken, or even baseball bat."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001Q72ARC,is it to heavy/long to use with one hand (so i could get the buckler shield as well...)?,"it is a bastard sword so as long as you're a relatively strong dude, you should be able to wield with one hand"

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001Q72ARC,"is it weighted (balanced) like a real, battle-ready, sword?","No, a functional sword has a balance point extending 2-4 inches from the cross guard. This practice sword is very poorly balanced, with a balance point extending about 9 inches from the cross guard."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001Q72ARC,Can you paint it to look real?,"That depends on how good of a painter you are. With the right paint yes very easily. However with the wrong paint it could easily chip if you plan on fighting with it once painted. Spray paint would be the best way to make the attempt, it won't chip and then you could fight with it."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001Q72ARC,it is BAD it is plastic,This is not a question; it's not even a sentence

As you move your foot farther down, it trips the cocking lever and lets the clay fly."

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00AU6DOA2,how cold can the TK40 be used in?,"Temperature will affect the batteries more than the camera...consider using Lithium AA batteries in place of standard AA cells.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000G3C5J0,How does it install on the gun?,"You remove the factory rear slide plate, which is very easy to do. Then you install the clipdraw rear slide plate, which has two small screw holes. Once the new plate is on you simply use two of the supplied small screws to attach the actual clip piece.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000G3C5J0,Is it useful for left hands? Is it possible to clip to another side of the glock?,Ye and yes realy left or right handed no difference
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000G3C5J0,Is it legal to carry this way?,Yes absolutely. You will need correct permits etc depending on the laws in your state

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000KKENMQ,Can this trap be set up by itself or does it need to be mounted to something?,"It has to be mounted on a post with 2 screws, but these fit into keyholes in the unit, so it can be fitted and taken down very easily."

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000KKENMQ,Is this able to hold A4 size paper target?,not familiar with a4 - size it takes = 5 x 5 1/2

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NADHIO,Will this work in a compact INOX?,"NO ! As stated, ""for FULL size 92/96 series pistols"" The ""compact"" models would need a shorter guide rod."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NADHIO,Will This Fit a Taurus PT92 With Rail,"Since it's a licensed version of the Beretta 92, if it uses the same type of recoil rod and spring, it should just drop in."

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NADHIO,does it fit a full sized beretta px4 storm?,"No, this only fits the beretta 92fs/a1"
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NADHIO,will this work with the Taurus 92 ? basically the same gun even save factory,You answered your own question! Should reduce felt recoil a bit but be aware that the cheap material they use as a buffer will mushroom and hang up on your spring after 3 boxes of ammo!!!!!
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000NADHIO,will this buffer work on a Beretta 92 D Centurion,Not familiar with the Centurion model. As long as its a full size gun this set up will work. Shorter length barrels require a shorter stroke rod and spring.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0019ZE9WU,Will the Champion Taxi fit the Doubles Trap?,"Yes it will.  However, an alternative is to go to your nearest Harbor Freight store and buy a cheaper two wheel hand truck and adapt your EasyBird to it.  It will transport way easier on pneumatic tires than the solid rubber tires that come with the trap taxi.  You can also replace the trap taxi tires with pneumatic tires also available from Harbor Freight."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0019ZE9WU,Will this model successfully shoot Walmart's White Flyer Biodegradable Targets,It will shoot any clays that are 108 or 110 mm.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,Will this pump work on another brands of air fork/shock?,Yes it will. They all use the same fitting so in that regard they are all universal.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,Is this a zero air loss when disconnecting from valve stem???,"Not zero but very minimal compared to standard pump. On shock i give one extra pump to get above expected PSI. Volume in shock is greatly reduced compared to a tire, so loss on tire would not be a factor."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,What is the lowest PSI,Gauge face shows lowest increment at 10 psi - 5 # increments through full range.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,"Will this work on the back (main) shock? have a Jamis w/Fox shock...reg. air hose is too big & leaks when used, need something smaller/precise.","The pump is small and accurate but has a limited lower range, in most cases...depending on your need and the psi range it should do the job."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,Will this work on the Fox Evo shocks?,ONLY UP TO 150 PSI.  Most front shocks require half your body weight and most rear shocks require your full body weight in PSI.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,Does the end piece swivel?,Yes the hose does swivel
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F212OK,can it adjust (decrease) the presure?,"yes , there is a button on the bottom , you can let pressure out."

GREAT BAG (especially for the price)"
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0024XEB7E,can this pistol be shipped to ny at zip code 11733?,"Sir, That zip code is not restricted as long as it's not in one of the Bouroghs"

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0024XEB7E,how do you load the pistol,The gun has a removable BB holder. See the picture: http://www.jakt-kungen.se/shop/24995/art95/h9463/12359463-origpic-8b5f63.jpg

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0030DBHGU,What is the best throwing tomahawk to learn on ?,"No, the handle is too long and the head is too light. It's a great hawk, best of the genre for the money, but it won't throw well. SOG makes one that is much easier to throw, made for that in fact and it is made of one piece of steel so it will stand up to the type of use it gets when someone is learning."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0030DBHGU,where is it made in,Either Arizona or California.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0030DBHGU,How thick is the blade?,The thickness of the blade is a 8th of a inch

Sports_and_Outdoors,B004QQRARU,Will the fit as a side mount on an AR 15?,It would be really high but it will fit.  It would be better to purchase a 45° mount for a fastfire 3.  This mount is meant to be used as a primary sight.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B004V957DG,Are all .22 pellet rifles one shot? Why?,"Since they are air powered, all the air is expelled on each shot (for pump-up style rifles). For break barrel style pellet guns, it's not possible to load more than one because the action of breaking the barrel down is what compresses spring to make the shot, and there's no way to get another pellet into the barrel until you break it down. If you want a repeating rifle, you'll probably have to go for a CO2 powered gun."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B004V957DG,is this just as good as the crosman optimus .177 just with a different caliber. Or does the caliber effect it?,".22 larger, so slower.  But packs more punch.  Would you rather be hit by a very fast pebble, or a fast rock?"
Sports_and_Outdoors,B004V957DG,can it kill a rabit,"It has decent velocity and shoots a 22 cal pellet.  If you hit a vital area, especially a head shot it will kill a rabbit."

Sports_and_Outdoors,B006Z7QTKM,how to replace batteries?,Carefully pull the rubber off the assembly. It comes off easily just has to be easy with it. Take a very small screw driver or a Pin.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B007BNHFLQ,what is the measurement of the bottom grippers at there widest point before compression?   Can they be locked in place on rail using the allen screws?,"Heres how it works - you fit the spring loaded adapter inside the mounting jaws of the weaver based device [scope mount,etc,]. Then you place the whole works onto the top of gun with the teeth of the adapter inserted into the dovetail grooves. Then you tighten the jaws of the mount with its own screws till all is firmly held in the dovetail."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B007BNHFLQ,do this adapters come in a set of 2 for the front and rear mounts,"Yes, you get a set of 2 with this order."

Sports_and_Outdoors,B007BNHFLQ,"i have a browning pump rifle 22 cal,will this work in the factory groves",Yes it will but realize that if you mount a heavy red dot on a single adapter it may not hold it to the dovetail on the rifle. A scope on two adapters holds up well. This comes with two adapters.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B007BNHFLQ,How to tighten the adapter - i don't see the bolts????,"There are no bolts, this is an insert which you slip inside the larger weaver style scope ring to reduce it down to fit 3/8 or 11 mm dovetailed receivers.There are two spring loaded alignment pins in between the two halves to keep them lined up with each other.It is the most compact adapter on the market at this time and adds the least height to the scope installation."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B007BNHFLQ,Will these work with an 11 mm dovetail of a CZ 455?,11 mm dovetail is 11 mm dovetail on what ever it is found... should do...

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0083IPQLO,is this compound bow good for hunting and is the bow for adults,"This is a youth bow, it has a very short draw length (12""-24"") and the pull weight is only 29 pounds not legal for hunting. So not for use by adults. It is a great bow to start children on."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0083IPQLO,is it good at hunting with it,"not out of the box, but with some light tuning, it would be good for small game, it doesn't have enough pounds to take out a deer. The arrows that come with it, also are fixed tips, so you would need arrows cut to have a hunting tip, as they are field tips."

Sports_and_Outdoors,B008PPT5ZS,how do you set it up? would it work well for a cruise?,Why would you take it on a cruise? It is very easy to set up but the poles attach to stakes that you stick in the sand.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B008PPT5ZS,Will this stay up on a windy beach?,The tent is well made but better stakes or sandbags would keep it grounded.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00EOA7QIG,how long does this extended from where you would attach it to the bike,It is not extendable. The length and rise are both fixed.
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00EOA7QIG,Hello. Does this fit on riser handle bars?,Yes they can fit almost all bars. They can be removed and installed quickly.  Cheap and flimsy but will give you a place to rest on long solos.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00EOA7QIG,can you hold /use the bike top handle bar comfortably while riding with this Aero bar installed,"The most honest answer is barely. You can squeeze your hands under the rests or adjust the position of the rests together but neither is a good long distance solution, the other option is use the bars for what you bought them for, or look for ones with spring loaded rest risers."
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00EOA7QIG,Will these aero bars fit on 31.8 mm handlebars?,Is it possible to purchase 31.8 clamp to use with these handle bars
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00EOA7QIG,Will this fit a standard mountain bike style handlebar? Thank you!,"It will depend on your model, if you look up the bike online it will tell you the diameter of your handlebars, the listing tells you what size handlebars it will fit."

If you read the description it states ""near vertical"".

Sports_and_Outdoors,B002UIX8PO,What is the inner diameter of the grip?,20 mm = 3/4 of an inch
Sports_and_Outdoors,B002UIX8PO,Will this fit on bars that are 7/8 inch  ?,Yes....but ill give you a tip...lube handle bars with rubbing alcohol first. They will slide on and the alcohol evaporates after making them a tight fit.

The turret ring would not support a three ring turret."

There is enough headroom with this press to handle pretty much any cartridge a sporting rifle has ever been chambered for so long as it can be done with standard 7/8""-14 dies. The press can handle the length of the .50 Browning, but since the diameter of that round requires 1 1/4"" diameter dies, it's a no-go. Who can think of any cartridge longer than a .50 Browning that one would ever handload?"
Sports_and_Outdoors,B003BWTF1E,This press has a very tight spot when pulling the handle down about half way and in the same spot on the way back up. Any ideas to free it up?,check to see if tou mounted it to close to the top of the bench.this can cause linkage to bind.

Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,What is flap size?,The size of the flap
Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,"Is the liner removable so that this can be put on a thin, panel door?","No, it is not.  The spacer is molded into one of the exterior sections.

The best solution is a plywood shim plate on each side that fits the cat door to a thinner door."
Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,Do the cats' tails get caught or hurt from the flap closing?,The flap doesn't slam down that fast & the animals' tails are able to hold the flap up and do not get caught.  Never had a problem yet (have had these doors and 3 cats plus 1 dog have used them).

Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Is this a good cage for an adult sized bearded dragon? He is currently in a 40 gal tank,"No only if you turn it down to a horizontal position to tall. Dragons need lite close and they don't climb , this cage is more so for iguannas un less you turn it down"
Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,is this strong enough for a large snake?,"Depends on the snake. Id say a snake that gets about 4-6 ft. in length and also lives mostly in trees (or climbing environment) would be a good fit, personally id go with a glass/acrylic tank for a snake environment if it isnt a species known to climb. This cage will also make it more difficult to keep high humidity due to the air flow. You will also most likely have to weigh down the bottom to avoid it tipping over with a large snake. You're better off getting a large tank instead."
Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Is the screen nylon or metal?,The screen is aluminum unlike the other screen cages on the market which are actually Teflon-coated steel that rusts (test them with a magnet). It is the same quality/thickness as window screening.

Pet_Supplies,B009S15ZVG,does this heating pad works for baby parakeets,"It's not really a heating pad, it's just a fuzzy cloth cover for a heating pad.  Hope this helps."
Pet_Supplies,B009S15ZVG,How long does this product remain warm?  Is there an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time?,Stays warm as long as it is plugged in.
Pet_Supplies,B009S15ZVG,Is it compatible with 200V?,This product is just a zippered pouch.  There is no electrical component whatsoever.  The picture is deceptive.

Office_Products,B003BNY7PM,Is the speakerphone full duplex?,"Full duplex.  When using the speaker phone, both parties (caller and you) can talk at the same time.  The phone will transmit your voice and let you hear the calling party simultaneously.  Without full duplex the two parties have to take turns talking.

Gwen D,"By default, the printer warms up and goes into ""normal"" print quality mode, not ""best"" (what you want) or ""fast"" (poor/draft quality).  It does this for many reasons, primarily to save ink since most people print typical documents containing mostly text, not graphics.  You can always change the printer's quality from normal to best by going to: Devices & Printers ->  Brother mfc-j6520dw -> Adjust Print Options.  If you mostly print images that require hi-resolution (lots of ink), you can set ""best"" quality as your default."
