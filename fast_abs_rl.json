    "ref": "Virtually all PCs and monitors use the standard 'kettle' lead connector for power. Typically you'll need two power cables, one for the PC and one for the monitor. Some monitors, however, have an external power supply, so you won't plug the kettle lead directly into the monitor. The mic stand is compatible with all microphones. Put something that can absorb sound underneath the keyboard, like a thin foam mat. Sound travels along multiple paths, including some that reflect up to a microphone from a hard desk surface. The Shure SM57 is one of the most widely used mics for guitar amps, but some other favorites include Sennheiser's e609 Silver, e906, and MD 421 II; Audix's i5; Royer's R-121; Telefunken's M81; and the Neumann U 47 fet. Choosing the best universal microphone shock mount is interesting because most microphone brands offer their own compatible shock mounts that are designed to perfectly fit the microphone they are designed for. In some cases, they don't offer a compatible shock mount, which is a great reason to get a universal one. Phantom power, commonly designated as +48V or P48, was designed to power microphones without using bulky external power supplies such as the ones required for tube microphones. It's most widely used as a power source for condenser microphones, which have active electronics. Be sure to verify whether your microphone is a condenser type or another type such as dynamic or ribbon. If it is a condenser microphone it will need phantom power, if it is a different type of microphone it will not."

Waterproof means that they are impervious to water. Vetco recommends, as a general rule, not to connect more than three complete strips end-to-end without adding in extra, higher gauge power wire or additional power supply units down the line. Two of the most common remote control battery types include rechargeable lithium ion and alkaline batteries. These remote control batteries are easy to charge and minimize the need for purchasing replacement batteries. One remote can control multiple receivers. You need to match the code with each receiver by using a remote controller. First, hold the ON button for 5 seconds, then LED strips light will flash which means the remote has paired with the receiver successfully. The controller will remember all your data, including watering schedules, reports, and system settings. When the controller powers back on, it will automatically reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. Light dimmers save energy by reducing the flow of electricity to the bulb and allowing lights to operate with lower power outputs. Since lights under less stress shine longer, dimmers are known to extend the life span of your bulbs."

If the Automatic Record function is enabled, the recording will automatically start right after the device turns on. See Set Automatic Recording or more information. It has a built in battery with a limited amount of run time after charging with the 12v cigarrette plug in. You will have to keep it plugged in to guarantee the video is always being recorded. It can be set to stay on or off during recording. You will see a pulsating red light to indicate it is recording. Just like any digital media, the file sizes will vary when recording video from segment to segment. But a 32 GB card will record a lot of 5 minute segments, or a week or more of driving if you are using this in your vehicle."

The long extended cable  is for relocation of the body and the short one is for radio when unitized. The radio uses standard USB type A for plugging to the computer and the radio accepts a usb mini type plug for connections. The current radio build version (TH-9800) lacks support for programming with CHIRP 4.1. However, the upcoming beta update for CHIRP is 4.2 will probably provide support for TH-9800. The radio only supports an FM of range 26-33MHz. The radio comes with a case on the upper side a speaker mounted on top. The radio is a quad-band of 11 meters (CB) with AM and SSB. The CB European FM mode is PMR446 (70 cm HAM band for Canada and US frequencies), and has a max of 500 MW. In FM mode, it operates in 10m HAM, and has extra Ham bands (6 meters, 2 meters, and 70 centimeters)."

Rotations may be clockwise or counterclockwise. Other LED bulbs simply get less bright, without the cozy glow. To control a remote-controlled ceiling fan without using the remote, add a pull cord to the pull switch on the motor module. The pull cord can be purchased from a hardware store or garden and patio shop, while the tools needed are already in most households. You may need a light kit to install your fan. If you do not need a light kit, a switch housing cap will be inside the original Hunter box. Ceiling fans should be installed, or mounted, in the middle of the room and at least 7 feet above the floor and 18 inches from the walls. If ceiling height allows, install the fan 8 - 9 feet above the floor for optimal airflow. Most standard mount fans that hang from a down rod will put the blades about 12\" from the ceiling making them appropriate for rooms with ceilings that are 8 feet or higher. Flush mount fans are designed for rooms with low ceilings that are less than 8 feet. The generally accepted rule for hanging dining room chandeliers is that the bottom of the fixture should hang between 30 and 36 inches above the top of the dining table. This range assumes you have an 8-foot ceiling."
