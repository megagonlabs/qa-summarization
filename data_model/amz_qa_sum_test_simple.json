Rained (not wind) a lot and completely dry inside.Does this tent  have (and can you describe) an electric cord entrance? Im not sure I understand the question but I will try to answer it anyway.

More importantly, the position and the light switch by the door make it super handy....this is a real nice touch on this tent.How's the light at night? Does it sufficiently illuminate the inside? I would describe it as equivalent to lantern light.  It was very nice to have.

The main problem is that residual wine will drip from the aerator into the holding cup, so you have to clean everything after each use.Do you find this easy to clean? It's very easy to clean, dishwasher safe actually.Do you find this easy to clean? So far I've just run hot water through it with a little dish soap. No build up in the few days I've been using it. I don't see how else you could clean it though.Do you find this easy to clean? Yes. I just run hot water through it. I don't use detergent just because I have this thing about lingering taste of the soap.Do you find this easy to clean? I rinse it under water after each use and have no problems at all. I would not let it sit an extended period of time with wine remnants in it. That would require soaking and cleaning.Do you find this easy to clean? Yes, but you need to rinse it as you use it.  As you know, wine can be quite sticky.  Rinse as you go, and you'll have no problems!Do you find this easy to clean? I've been using this aerator a couple times a week for the last 6 months and slowly over time there is a sludge build up inside. There is no way of opening the aerator to properly clean it. We've been washing it with hot soapy water but the water can only run through the middle so there is no way to scrub it.  I also found that bits of food can get caught inside when washed in the dishwasher. Throwing this in the garbage as I don't want my wine running through built up sludge.Do you find this easy to clean? Just a good rinse with warm water after using seems to work pretty well for mine.  :)aerator for rose wine? Zazzol wine aerator transforms any wine to great wine instantly.

To make an absolutely transparent broth you can not just use a strainer even of the finest mesh. You can come close with a combination of this item plus the use of a jelly strainer. To be completely transparent you must follow directions for consomm\u00e9 in a good cook book, it is not and easy task without serious skill.

The product is great for straining the fine powder of tea leaves. The solid band is  included in the dimensions of the strainer. The product will strain out the raspberry seeds, but it may have trouble getting the puree out of strainer as well. The product and the chinois have different filtering capacities, as the chinois is stronger and is less likely to be damaged when material is pushed through it harder. The product is for smaller applications. The product can strain broth effectively, except for very small particle. It will take some time to strain a large pot as the product can only do small volumes.

There is no reason why this lamp wouldn't be compatible with an LED bulb. Like Wesley said, the major drawback with LED bulbs is that they will not cast light uniformly like a traditional style bulb. Although, I recently purchased a few 9.5 watt \"Cree\" brand LED bulbs and have been extremely pleased with them. You're looking at $9 a bulb, but I was amazed by the output. I read 3-4 non-amazon reviews before buying and Cree was the closest thing to incandescent bulbs as you can get.Will the lamp work with an LED bulb? YES! And I highly recommend it because it doesn't heat up, which makes it safer to use plus it's also energy efficient. Also, using a 40W equivalent LED Globe bulb worked best for me in terms of lighting (that is, if you want your light to be bright but also very relaxing for the eyes) and this bulb, specifically, is really durable.

Can you only power one set at a time or can you have both on for a surround set-up? Yes, you can do a quadraphonic setup on the receiver to play four speakers. You will have to set the system to 4 Ohms to evenly distribute the power which is recommended by Onkyo.  It will not be true surround, just 4-way stereo, hence quadraphonic stereo.On this system there is a speaker set A and B.  Can you only power one set at a time or can you have both on for a surround set-up? The Speaker A and B buttons on the front individually turn on or off either set of speakers.

Can you only power one set at a time or can you have both on for a surround set-up? I have not tried this but from the manual it describes utilizing both the A and B speaker sets. If this is similar to the stereo receivers of the 70s-80s, you would not want to use 4 ohm rated speakers as what normally happens is the speakers get paralleled and the resistance/impedance drops to 2 ohms and that the amp would never be able to handle without shutting down. If I remember, I will test this and comment further but everything I have read says this should work with 8 ohm rated speakers.On this system there is a speaker set A and B.  Can you only power one set at a time or can you have both on for a surround set-up? Both A+B can be run at the same time. The manual will show you how to set the receiver to the 4 ohm setting. Your speakers must be 8 ohmor 16 ohm. This unit is high current, low ohmage, which is very good. Do not place anything on the top so it can breath. It will run cool. Great unit.On this system there is a speaker set A and B.  Can you only power one set at a time or can you have both on for a surround set-up? You can connect two pairs of speakers and switch the pairs on or off individually.  BUT this is NOT \"surround sound\" or \"Quadraphonic\".  It's just two pairs of stereo speakers.  This is a two channel (stereo) receiver.  For true surround sound or quadraphonic, you will need an amplifier with more channels or several of these amplifiers wired to provide the front pair, center, and back pair with their own independent channels.Can the RCA output be used at the same time as the normal speakers?

{"asin": "B000TJWSUM", "text": "How do you eliminate the opening where the sun shines through between the car visor and this product?? Sally, there's a very simple answer. When the Polarized visor is mounted as instructed, it's on the bottom of the car visor. Pull it down from the car visor just about half-way, and then push the car visor all way forward towards the windshield (if the polarized visor was still folded up, it would actually be on top of the car visor). Then just adjust the polarized visor to your correct height by tilting it towards you or lowering the car visor a bit. There won't be any gap.How do you eliminate the opening where the sun shines through between the car visor and this product?? Sally,  The way I do this is by changing the angular relationship between the car visor and the polarizing filter. I drop the car visor just enough to deploy the filter and then angle the filter to get it before my eyes but not so much as to create the gap you are talking about.  I believe if you experiment with this idea you will find it works.  But be aware this filter is not for direct sunlight relief.  Polarizing filters are for reflected light.  If you are going to drive during hours of low direct sunlight you will need a dark shade filter in addition to this products.  MarkHow do you eliminate the opening where the sun shines through between the car visor and this product?? Hi Sally,  If the car visor is at a 90 degree angle from the roof of the car, the gap shows and sunlight comes through.  But by tilting the car visor 80-85 degree angle and with the attached visor pulled down, the gap is not seen.  Thus your eyes are not blinded by the sun.  I especially love it on those times driving into the sunset.How do you eliminate the opening where the sun shines through between the car visor and this product?? Sally, I can't remember exactly, so you might have to experiment with my explanation.  I removed the \"visor piece\" from the unit, and turned it around.

Hope the long answer helps.How is it installed, when folded up and out of the way, is the visor laying against the visor mirror?  Also  is there a way to Looking at how other folks answered this question, I installed it differently as I am not one to even use the mirror. I would take their advice and install it on the outside surface so the mirror is still available.  That being said, I am not a mirror user, so it is not an issue with me.  Plus the fact that I live in Michigan, not Florida, so I will probably take the visor off in winter when we don't have much sun.  Would I buy it again or recommend it?  Yes, I love it!  It functions very well and is a good design.  Is it a bit pricey?  Yes, but you get what you pay for.How is it installed, when folded up and out of the way, is the visor laying against the visor mirror?  Also  is there a way to Hi Becky!  It is installed by metal clips backup by straps with velcro for a very secure mount.  I have installed it on the outside surface of the visor so it is not covering the mirror.

To block sun shine, pull it down about half-way from the car visor and push the car visor all the way forward towards the windshield. Take note if the visor is folded, it would be on top of the car visor. Then adjust the polarized visor to the correct height by tilting it or lowering the car visor. The product is polarized and the entire tint is effective in lowering the Sun's glare. The product will stay in place as long as the pins are not spread apart. There is only one visor so a second purchase is needed if the passenger side needs one. The visor is installed on the underside of the car visor and does not lay against the mirror. The visor cuts down on nighttime headlight glare with no visual impairment issues. The visor is strapped to the visor so it may not be able to block headlights at night from oncoming cars. The car model and size are possible factors that may affect that. The visor helps with oncoming headlights both in the day and night. "}

We leave it up for at least two days and then put it away.  To be honest, the only hassle is drying it out and folding it up to put it away but worth it.  We just take care of it so no mold stains happen to it.  Hours of fun for the kids and even use it for birthday parties twice now.Does it tie down? I  have no opened it yet.

And of course water is a natural cushion.Is the splash pool cushioned (or inflated) on the bottom?  Or do the children slide down the slide right on to the ground? Its not cushioned but the slide flattens out at the bottom. And both my kids love it and my daughter has been using it with no complaints since she was a year and 9 months. Plus they are sliding into water so that works as a cushion.Is the splash pool cushioned (or inflated) on the bottom?  Or do the children slide down the slide right on to the ground? The pool area has no cushion on the bottom. So yes they land on the ground. We put ours in the grass so it's not to bad, also the kids stop before getting to the ground most often.

Splash pool is not cushioned or inflated.  With or without water I have not encountered any problemsIs the splash pool cushioned (or inflated) on the bottom?

Hi Laurelic   Kids slide onto ground  base is thick enought. Ours is on dirt.

In order for continuous spray the hose does have to be connected and on. It doesn't cycle the water.Does there have to be a water hose attached and running at all times or does it cycle the water? Yes, a water hose must be attached and if you want the water spray on slide and walls of pool area the water must be running from the hose. It does not recycle the water, sadly.Must add though, I have 5, 3 and 1 year olds and they all love this thing. I let the pool fill up enough to make it fun and then shut the water off. They forget about the water spray by then and are having a BLAST!!! ;-)Does there have to be a water hose attached and running at all times or does it cycle the water? water hose attached all the time,once the bottom areas fill i shut off water for a while and turn it on again for the sprinklers on to and sides to work.

The bounce part can be used dry, but the slide needs to be wet, otherwise kiddos get stuck sliding down the slide down it and they also land straight on hard ground without the pool filled.Can this be used wet or dry? Yes. Particularly the ball pit part. The slide works best wet though, in my opinion.Can this be used wet or dry? We have used it both wet and dry. It's more fun wet but I would have to yes, it can be used both ways. IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!! My kids love it. Make sure to get the bag of 100 plastic balls too.

When used dry you just need to make sure that no sharp objects are on or in the kids clothing. We used it dry in the spring when it was not warm enough yet. However, wet it seemed a lot more fun for the kidsCan this be used wet or dry? We use it wet or dry.  The water in the pool doesn't fill high enough to really cushion the landing on the slide, so it's pretty hard either way.  The plastic gets hot in the sun so check it often when using dry.  The kids love it either way.  Well worth the price.Can this be used wet or dry? Yes!  But the slide is a little more difficult to get down if its not wet.Can this be used wet or dry? Yes absolutely!

The thumb stud sucks though, it is too close to the base of the blade, which makes it very difficult to use. It was mostly intended for using the flipper that sticks out the top of the handle, which is essentially the blade guard, once deployed.Does the thumb stud protrude on both sides of the blade so that the blade can be opened one-handed in either hand with just the thumb? As Lyle said, it sucks. I can't actually use it to open the blade. The flipper works well though and with the SpeedSafe feature, the flipper is all you really need.Does the thumb stud protrude on both sides of the blade so that the blade can be opened one-handed in either hand with just the thumb? That actually is a blade stop and not a thumb stud. It's not meant for opening the knife. That's what the flipper is for. The flipper can be used with either hand.Does the thumb stud protrude on both sides of the blade so that the blade can be opened one-handed in either hand with just the thumb? I have found that using the thumb stud with the flipper speeds the opening by a fraction of a second. Try it out everyone, just put your thumb on the thumb stud and apply pressure then flip the blade with the flipper. Takes a little practice but you will notice an improvement in speed.Does the thumb stud protrude on both sides of the blade so that the blade can be opened one-handed in either hand with just the thumb? Yes...both sides.is this knife spring assisted? Check out Kershaw speed safe. Its an over center cam. When closed, stays closed.

Yes, mine recently broke (spring popped out of place) but it is an easy fix with the proper toolsI would recommend this as a starter EDC knife for light use but I am personally upgrading to a SOG Trident soon.is this knife spring assisted? Yes, and no. SpeedSafe is Kershaw's rendition of \"spring assisted.\" Function-wise, yes it opens like a spring assisted. However, some states have restrictions on spring assisted knives, yet to my knowledge, Kershaw's SpeedSafe is legal in all 50 states.how well does the blade sharpen and how long does it stay sharp under use ?? It sharpens very well. The tanto blade is no problem. The blade does need to be sharpened often under hard daily use.how well does the blade sharpen and how long does it stay sharp under use ?? It actually sharpens very well, and quickly! 8Cr13MoV is a high-grade stainless steel that is slightly softer than, say, AUS-8 (itss most comparative steel, some say). With a good diamond sharpener, I've found that the blade sharpens fast, and stays sharp under normal/moderately extreme use, from breaking down cardboard boxes to carving sandstone (though highly possible, the latter use is not a good use for any knife). Try the Smith's PocketPal sharpener or one of Kershaw's sharpeners. Hope that helps!how well does the blade sharpen and how long does it stay sharp under use ?? It sharpens really well but I feel that it doesn't really stay sharp for a while. It's not my EDC of choice.how well does the blade sharpen and how long does it stay sharp under use ?? Sharpenes easily and quickly stays sharp fairly long time considering the price it is a little hard to sharpen the tanto edge at the end. For the price I paid it is well worth it. If you want awesome sharpness get so etching with D2 steel that stuff is amazinghow well does the blade sharpen and how long does it stay sharp under use ?? I've had it for a month today, the 11th. It came to me out of the box, Sharp as a razor. It is used daily for random little things. As of today it is still sharp enough to take the hair off my arm. I am not too sure as to how well it Sharpens, but it stays pretty sharp for a long time. If you want a knife that wont cost you a fortune, then go with this one. You will not be let down by it.how well does the blade sharpen and how long does it stay sharp under use ?? I carry mine every day, but probably only use it a few times a week. Under those conditions, I'd say it holds its edge extremely well. I've sharpened mine 3 times in 2 years. The first 2 times with an inexpensive pocket sharpener that worked surprisingly well. The 3rd and last time I sharpened it with an oilstone that gave it a razor sharp edge. I *love* this knife.Anyone know what type and size of wrench is needed to move the pocket clip? Thanks!

I have not needed to oil the blade or anything else to counter act rusting it has a coating on the blade not sure what it is but no rust!Does the blade require any abnormal or unusual maintenance or oiling to prevent long-term rusting? No. This tanto does have the protective coating to prevent rust, but a light coat of oil can't hurt, especially if u live in a high humidity area or long term storage.Does the blade require any abnormal or unusual maintenance or oiling to prevent long-term rusting?

Where the blade is so large I would go with stones to sharpen, however the blade came super sharp and is still that way.

But the overall measurement includes not just the blade and grip, but also the finger guard, and the butt of the hilt of the knife's grip.

No, it doesn't swivel that far.   It is designed for the lamp to point down, not up.Can the lamp swivel to a point where the bulbs are pointing up, towards the ceiling? No.  The metal lid/cover over the bulb does not swivel allowing a change in the direction of the light.  A drawback, in my opinion.  The arm does swivel so the light can be shifted from straight down on your work surface to up on a wall, but I haven't found that swivel to be helpful.  The light emitted is very good, easy on the eyes.  But there is relatively little flexibility to adjusting the angle of the light down onto the surface below, or the height of the light.Can the lamp swivel to a point where the bulbs are pointing up, towards the ceiling? No it cannot. You can change the angle of the light until it is almost vertical, but not beyond that.Can the lamp swivel to a point where the bulbs are pointing up, towards the ceiling? No. The arm/light pivots up and down, but it will not rotate in order to face the bulb towards the ceiling. Its a great light and would not exchange it for another.", "summary": "The temperature of this metal is measured in degrees Kelvin. ... CRI is a measurement of a light source's accuracy in rendering different colors when compared to a reference light source with the same correlated color temperature. Full-size fluorescent lamps are available in several shapes, including straight, U-shaped, and circular configurations. Lamp diameters range from 1\" to 2.5\". The most common lamp type is the four-foot (F40), 1.5\" diameter (also called T12) straight fluorescent lamp. hanging a light bulb is one of the easiest things you can do. ... Changing a light bulb is as easy as home maintenance and DIY gets. The correct height of the table lamp is typically determined by the seating piece and the height of the table beside it. The table lamp should be tall enough for the bottom of the lampshade to come to the eye level of the person seated beside it. Buzzing in CFL bulbs is common and is not dangerous. The buzzing is most likely caused by a hum in the ballast. ... Older CFL bulbs have magnetic ballasts, as opposed to newer electrical ballasts, and give off a louder buzz. There are three primary types of voltage transformers (VT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic voltage transformer is a wire-wound transformer. To determine power in Watts, simply multiply Volts times the current in Amps. The 60 Hz doesn't matter. For a 120 volt outlet with nothing plugged in or whatever plugged in being off, the amps and therefore watts of the circuit is zero. If you're looking to light a very large room, upwards-facing lights will be more effective for diffusing light further, whereas downwards-facing lights would be sufficient if you're only lighting a small space. This would, however, also be subject to the primary use of the room. "}

You can also check all lens specs at the fujifilm website.Is this the most versatile prime XF lens? In other words, if you were only planning on carrying one prime, would this be it? Yes, it's the equivalent of 35mm on a full frame digital or film camera (not 50mm), and the fixed focal length built into the Fuji X100 and X100S. It is the ideal 'walk-a-bout' lens.Is this the most versatile prime XF lens? In other words, if you were only planning on carrying one prime, would this be it? Yes..  If I only had one prime it would be the 23mm because of the focal length.  Very nice lens.Is this the most versatile prime XF lens? In other words, if you were only planning on carrying one prime, would this be it? I usually think of zooms for versatility, but if you were just interested in a prime, I'd say this one was the best combination.  14mm is too wide.  35mm a bit too close (remember it's actually closer to 50mm when you take into account the cropped sensor).  23mm is a bit more flexible as well as being a great lens.Is this the most versatile prime XF lens? In other words, if you were only planning on carrying one prime, would this be it? I have purchased other Fuji XF lenses, and i keep the 23mm lens on there at all times. It's my favorite lens. Others are smaller, but none feel or work as well as the 23. It's tack sharp even at 1.4. I would make this my lone prime, if that was your option.Is this the most versatile prime XF lens? In other words, if you were only planning on carrying one prime, would this be it? Yes, for me it will be. However, this depends on your photography style, and only you will know what your photography style is.Is this the most versatile prime XF lens? In other words, if you were only planning on carrying one prime, would this be it? I'd say it is indeed the most versatile focal length prime Fuji makes, and if I'm carrying only one lens, this one is usually it.  I like wide-angle quite a bit, and so I sometimes take only the 14mm instead.  I find the 35mm is too \"tight\" a focal length for my style, but it really depends on you and what you like to photograph.  23mm on a 1.5x body is a nice length for \"environmental portraits\" but too wide for traditional head/bust compositions.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? In terms of handling color, sensitivity to low light conditions, and precision of focusing, the 18-55mm lens is no match to the excellent XF 23 lens.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? I absolutely love this lens. It's by far the best glass fuji did so far.That zoom is now in the drawer for ever.Using that lens in full aperture is a delight.I strongly recommend to get a good BW ND filter 1.8 so you could use it at full aperture in daylight.Go for it, you won't regret!How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? To be honest, unless you need 1.4 or the DOF scale, or minimum distortion at 23mm, the 18-55 is going to be better simply because of the IOS. I own this lens and I love it, but it really doesn't provide much over the 18-55, and I actually keep the 18-55 on most of the time unless I am going to do street photography in daylight.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? For me its the lens I hd to have and I'm very happy with it. 35mm equivalent is one of my two favorite focal lengths 85mm (new XF 56) is the other. I also like the clutch based manual focus. The 23 is the lens I use the most. Only take out the 18-55 when I need to travel lighter.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? Although the 18-55 lens is a very good lens for a zoom, the 23 prime lens is far superior in my opinion in many ways especially with the 1.4 speed but the optics are extremely good in the 23 and the lens is built beautifully.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? My wife uses this lens more than I do, so I can't speak specifically to its performance at 23mm, but my general impression is that it's a great lens. Really solid build, nice feel to it, and excellent optics. A way better lens than I had expected.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? The 18-55 is a great lens, but the 23mm prime is a magic lens. Since I've acquired the 23mm I hardly use my 18-55. Maybe it's still the honeymoon phase, but I just love the 23. It renders images in a different way than the 18-55, and the speed/DOF of 1.4 really does make a difference.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? I have both lenses and use them differently. The 23mm I mainly use when street shooting. But since I got the 23mm, I've don't use my 18-55 as much.How do you like this lens vs. using the 18-55mm zoomed to 23mm? No comparison. Ability to go to F1.4 makes the depth of field control so much better. These two lens are in completely different class.Does this come with international warranty?

Depends on what you're looking for?This lens has two stops more light gathering ability and thus much shallower DOFIt is much heavier though, but not by any amount that means you can't carry it around all day easily.Indiscreetness aside, would this be worth the extra $ as a walk around lens over the 27mm 2.8? If you need the extra stops of last get, yes. For night or low light shooting, it's perfect. I own both and enjoy using each for different situations. The 27mm is great for a compact kit, the 23 is just amazing for sharpness and the extra width to the field of view can be quite useful. Only you can decide if it's worth it. Best way to determine which one- rent them and compare with your own eyes.Indiscreetness aside, would this be worth the extra $ as a walk around lens over the 27mm 2.8? You have what you pay for. The 23 is superb and fast. The 27 is not a bad lens, but the main point of it is not IQ, it's portability.Indiscreetness aside, would this be worth the extra $ as a walk around lens over the 27mm 2.8? They are both excellent lenses, and I own both. The 27 usually gets the nod for walk-around shooting for compactness and light weight. I use the 23 for work. The 27 renders beautiful images on the Fuji sensor, nothing at all wrong with its image quality. I do think that the regular price is high for this lens, as it's often on rebate so I waited to buy it.It appears that f-stops can be set directly on the lens.  Is this correct?  Do all Fuji XF lenses have this same capability? Yes, for the 23mm F1.4, it is on the lens? In the XF series of Fuji lenses, the XF27mm is the one exception. For that lens you use the rear dial.It appears that f-stops can be set directly on the lens.  Is this correct?  Do all Fuji XF lenses have this same capability? Yes, with the Fuji 23mm you can set the FStops directly on the marked aperture ring on the lens in 1/3 click stopped steps.  Action is light and smooth with pronounced stops but not stiff so it is easy to unintentionally move it off the mark you set, for example moving the camera in and out of a bag.  You may also set it so the camera selects the aperture for you (in program or shutter priority), this does not lock into place like other camera lenses.  Do all Fuji XF lenses have this, no.  You can check Fuji's website for more info on which lenses do.It appears that f-stops can be set directly on the lens.  Is this correct?  Do all Fuji XF lenses have this same capability?

The manual focusing is by wire, but it is much more responsive than the 35 1.4.Is manual focusing directly mechanical or electronically \"by-wire\" controlled? Good question, I actuLly had to play with it to be sure. While the 23mm looks and feels very mechanical it is actually \"by wire\" like other Fuji lens. Unlike many other Fuji lenses it has stops at both ends of its focus range so you can easily pre-focus. It also has focus distance and DOF scales. This is a Great lens, don't let the \"by-wire\" put you off.Is manual focusing directly mechanical or electronically \"by-wire\" controlled? The manual focusing is \"by-wire\". It's very natural, I found it easy to get used to and easy to use.Is manual focusing directly mechanical or electronically \"by-wire\" controlled?

This is a versatile lens that could be equated with 35mm rather than 50mm for a film or full frame digital camera, as well as the fixed focal length of models like the Fuji X100 and X100S.

This product offers an international warrant, but you must have access to a certified Fujifilm merchant or Fujifilm center for service. This lens is significantly heavier than the 27mm 2.8, although it can still be carried around. This lens also has shallower DOF due to its additional light gathering ability.

The large green bag looks just like the picture and has a capacity of 15 gallons.  It is able to supply water to the tree in a slow drip and is great for watering trees over several days. The bag is complete in one unit, can be filled from the top and has small holes in the bottom to facilitate watering. It has performed satisfactorily all summer in difficult to access locations and is an excellent purchase.Your description is for a 15 gallon original bag, From the Manufacturer Product Description it is a 20 gallon bag.  Which does the consumer get? According to the label on my Treegator, the product comes in two sizes - 15 gallon and 25 gallon.  I have four (4)  15 (15)gallon bags.  If someone is trying to sell you a 20 gallon bag, I would verify that the supplier is Treegator and not a knockoff.Your description is for a 15 gallon original bag, From the Manufacturer Product Description it is a 20 gallon bag.  Which does the consumer get? The amount of water a Treegator\u00ae Original is able to hold is dictated by the size of the tree it is used on, as well as the setup (i.e. single bag or double bag setup).A Treegator\u00ae Original can be used to water trees with a trunk caliper of 1\" (single bag setup) to 8\" (double bag setup).Taking into account all possible setup configurations, the quantity of water a single Treegator\u00ae Original bag can hold averages out to 20 gallons (75.705 liters).Does anyone have experience using this on a hillside?  Specifically, will this work on a 45-degree sloped hillside? If you are using a Treegator\u00ae Original bag on a sloped surface, make sure that the zippers are on the uphill side of the slope. This will allow the bag to drain properly every time it is filled. If you are using the product on a slope greater than 25 top 30 degrees, you definitely want to make sure that the planting is properly staked, and ensure that the bag will not be too heavy when leaning on the trunk (particularly when using on trees from 1 to 2 inches in trunk diameter)Does anyone have experience using this on a hillside?  Specifically, will this work on a 45-degree sloped hillside? It does work on a slope, although the most I have used it on is about 30 degrees. The bag will lean against the trunk, but the majority of the weight is low and it drains relatively quickly. You might want to tape up the downhill seep hole on the bottom of the bag.Does it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? Depends on how you water those trees now.  If you are hand watering them now, then absolutely.  If you depend on rainwater and they are ok, then not really needed.Does it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? First I would recommend using the circular shaped bag. These ripped when we zipped them up for the first time. A tree that old can sustain itself with natural irrigation. However if you are experiencing drought conditions it would be beneficial to use these. Or if you are using fertilzer and it is dry or hotter conditions. Just be careful not to over water as it would be worse then under watering the tree. If you know the tree type look up its watering needs and soil conditions, some trees prefer wet roots i.e. pussy willow and some dry i.e. kousa dog wood.Does it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? Absolutely does make sense if you are in a drought condition as we areDoes it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? Yes, It absolutely does if you are in a drought condition as we are.  You just can't water enough,  if you have a few mature trees, it will pay you to water them if you are not getting sufficient rains.Does it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? It would be OK, as long as one bag would fit around the girth of the tree. For a big trunk, I've heard of using two together.Does it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? Trees that old have a very good root system, if they are healthy trees. Tree Gators are usually used on new trees that are just getting established, 4 years old trees still need help. If the weather is very, very, dry you might water older trees, but, usually just the young trees.Does it make sense to use them on older trees that have been in the ground 10 to 30 years>? no, because you water trees best at their dripline, not at the base of the tree (unless the dripline has a small diameter as with a young tree)Can they be filled and transported, or do they need to be filled at the tree location? They need to be filled at the tree. They have holes in the bottom that start dripping as soon as you fill it.Can they be filled and transported, or do they need to be filled at the tree location? filled at tree locationvery difficult to carry otherwiseCan they be filled and transported, or do they need to be filled at the tree location? they need to be filled at tree location. They have holes in the bottom, and the zip is difficult to close if the bag is fullCan they be filled and transported, or do they need to be filled at the tree location?

Not sure I fully understand the question...what do you mean without being planted?  It will sit upright on a flat surface, be it a deck or whatever, whether around a tree or not.

Be sure to check to see if Amazon's details give you that information.  If not, I'll measure and get back to you.Will this work on a deck, without being planted? Would the need to go into a larger planter to keep it upright? I doubt it.  The function of the Treegator is to allow water to slowly saturate into the soil.

If you are talking about using the Treegator with a potted tree, it might work but I would suggest a smaller Treegator.Why it it a problem  if the base of the tree is less that 2\"?

Also, trees smaller than 2\" may not yet be tall enough for the branches to clear the bag.Why it it a problem  if the base of the tree is less that 2\"?  Ways to correct it?

Yes, this model is balanced for the Northern Hemisphere.  That was something I contacted the company about prior.

I am unable to answer your question about the CS, but it was given as a gift and the recipient lives in New England, and it works well so, yes, for northern hemisphere.what is the eye slit thingy for? sorry if that sounds like a dumb question It's used for sighting the course you intend to follow. As you turn the compass to the magnetic direction you want to go the sight wire shows you where that direction is in the distance or on the horizon. It gives you a more precise reading to follow.what is the eye slit thingy for? sorry if that sounds like a dumb question It acts like a gunsight and focuser.  If you look through the slit, you can see both the wire and the distant object, so you can center the distant object on the wire.  The wire is in line with the center black line of the bezel.  Many persons may not see the wire and the distant object simultaneously because the wire is only inches from your eye, its very close.   The slit also then works then like a pinhole eyeglass or Inuit snow goggle allowing the user to focus easier and see the wire too.what is the eye slit thingy for? sorry if that sounds like a dumb question That is for shooting a sight line ,say to a pole about 600 feet away or a tree,then continuing. The lens is for Reading the numbers on the compass face,then shoot a bearing where you want to gowhat is the eye slit thingy for? sorry if that sounds like a dumb question When you shoot an azimuth, you will line up that U-shaped notch on top of the lens with the base of the sighting wire and look through the lens to read the number off your dial.  If you're trying to walk a straight line on a specific bearing (e.g., 325 degrees or N 35\u00b0 W), you can find a landmark right on the wire and walk towards it.  If you want to know the azimuth to a given landmark (or two landmarks, to triangulate your position), it's as easy as pointing your compass at it.what is the eye slit thingy for? sorry if that sounds like a dumb question No I asked also. With a compass, you look through the eyepiece and and fix the compass wheel point to line up with a landmark you want to get to. You then have the direction, north, south, etc to follow the compass line on.Can anyone please explain what \"balanced for the Northern Hemispere\" means? Guessing it it something to do with Magnetic North vs. Geographic North... Timothy,The Earth's magnetic poles are located above the surface of the Earth. When a compass is in the Northern Hemisphere, the magnetic pole is above the compass and pulls up on the North end of the needle. In the Southern Hemisphere the same is true for the South end of the needle. The compass is balanced by adding weight to the North end of the needle for compasses used in the Northern Hemisphere and weight to the South end of the needle for compasses used in the Southern Hemisphere.Can anyone please explain what \"balanced for the Northern Hemispere\" means? Guessing it it something to do with Magnetic North vs. Geographic North... Timothy,  The effect the earth has on the needle of  a compass is different in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere.  Compasses built for the northern part of the earth, above the equator have the needle \"balanced\" so that it is level when the compass is level.  If you buy a compass built by a company located  in the southern hemisphere the south end of the needle will probably float hi as compared to the north end.  Cammenga manufactures here in the USA so their compass card  is balanced for our local.  This military marching compass is really so  easy to use.  The body of  the compass has a nice straight edge along one side making it very useful when you want to align a map to any one of its three coordinates.  The military has used this compass for many years and it is a proven performer.  Note, if you want lots of features such as inclination, mirror imaging with see through hole, adjustable declination,  etc. there are lots of  much more complicated compasses available.All compasses point to the same place, magnetic north, no matter who made the compass.  However, the earth rotates on an axis running through the North Pole to the South Pole.  This axis is not magnetic, it is geographic and called \"true north.\"  Magnetic north is off to one  side of the axis, though this is a somewhat simple explanation.  If any compass points other than magnetic north then it has been adjusted for declination, the difference between true north and magnetic.

No it is not,so there is no bubble to center,it is a jeweled dial,faster and sureIs this compass liquid filled?

It is a good, non plastic compass.  I would buy this again knowing how sturdy it is.  Hope that this helps.Is this compass liquid filled? No it is NOT liquid filled.  The dial balances on a pivot point, and when the case is closed, the dial is locked into place to help prevent damage.Is this compass liquid filled? No, this is a \"magnetic induction\" compass. It is dampened magnetically and sits in a sealed, non-liquid-filled chamber. The military does this so that the compass will continue to function normally in the event the glass is broken.

Cameras and infrared detectors don't emit light - they just detect light and/or heat emanating from whatever source they are aimed at. There is nothing to measure.will this measure infrared or other emanations from spy cameras? Fathom,  The handbook does not specifically address infrared measurement.  The unit just measures overall illumination, that is all from what I gathered from the handbook.  I believe the instrument you want is not this one, the unit you want will probably cost much more and be rated for infrared.  Sorry, Charleywill this measure infrared or other emanations from spy cameras? Cameras typically don't emit much radiation of any kind, so if you are interested in sweeping a room for bugs, this device won't be useful.However it can be used to measure relatively high levels of radiation in the IR and UV spectra.  Its response to infrared and ultraviolet light is much lower than it is to the visible range, so its sensitivity in these areas is low.  Also it responds to all the frequencies it sees, so you need to cover its sensor with an IR filter.  Once you've done this, you should be able to calibrate it against a meter of known accuracy and precision.Will it give a reading of the wavelength of the light received , ie the color?

My experience cooking brats was not satisfactory. Since they usually are very large, only 3 will fit on the rollers at one time. Also the rollers did not keep them turning consistently because of the brats size.  I ended up cooking the brats in an oven.

The gauges will work with a Suzuki Intruder 1400 as long as the bike is equipped with a carburetor. Any motorcycles with a carb motor will be compatible with these gauges such as the Suzuki 1400 motorcycle. The gauges will work with a Honda Goldwing, any motorcycles with 1 to 4 carbs will be compatible with it. The gauges just need nipples to attach to each carb intake and will work with stuff like the 2004 Yamaha 50hp 4 stroke outboard.

The most important part is that the end of the compensator be at 90 degrees to the bore.What about an AK47? With the compensator it doesn't look like it would attach right. As long as the unit is allowed to attach magnetically, it should be as true as your barrel muzzle crown (or in your case the crown of the compensator) is to the bore.will it work on .177 cal ? If your .177 cal has a steel barrel it will work fine... It goes on the end of any caliber barrel. And the laser is pretty precise in the front...will it work on .177 cal ? It will work on any rifle. because unlike other bore sighters that insert into the barrel, the Wheeler uses a magnet and attaches to the end of the barrel. Just center it on the end of the barrel and sight it in. I found that it gets it extrememly close and will not take very many shots at the target to zero your rifle in.will it work on .177 cal ? Yes, it will work with ALL calibers, and why I purchased it. It uses a strong magnet to attach to the \"outside\" of the barrel rather the other models that attach within the barrel. The obvious advantage of surface attachment over internal attachment is that there is no intrusion of the sensitive crown portion on the barrel!will it work on .177 cal ? Nothing goes in the barrel thus it will work on any caliber. The switch on mine was faulty though otherwise it works  as intended, but not as well as I expected.

The Wheeler Laser Bore Sighter works by magnetically attaching to the muzzle end of your barrel. It will work as long as the muzzle end of your barrel is magnetic (most likely is) and it is perpendicular to the bore of your barrel (again this is also very likely unless you have somehow modified or damaged the muzzle end of your barrel). Hope this helps.will it work on .177 cal ? As long as your weapon has a barrel, it wiIl work.  This is not a \"inside the chamber\" laser bore sighter.

That solves the problem most of the time.Does anyone use this lens with Nikon D800? Can yo share your experience? I use this lens with my D800 with great success. It will show some flare now and then, but it has marvelous resolution. I use it on a tripod when working indoors since it has no VR, but outdoors not so much. Keep in mind that with the high pixel count of the 800, tripod work with the mirror up technique is important to get the full resolution the lens is capable of.Will this work on the Nikon D3100? It will work, but you will not receive the full benefit from it. This lens is made for a full frame (FX) camera and the D3100 is a crop frame camera. It will be like putting a 24-42mm lens on the D3100. You need to use a lens designated as DX for this camera. A better choice would be a DX lens that is something like 10-xx mm if you want something super wide.Will this work on the Nikon D3100? Yes it will!  But you shouldn't get it for your D3100.  It made to work perfect for Nikon FX (full frame) bodies, also TOO HEAVY for your D3100 body.

There is a version for DX, the Tokina 11-17  F2.8, that is highly regarded.  I have it and can use it on a full-frame camera, but had I known I was going to get a full-frame so quickly I would have purchased the FX version.  The issue is that your camera relies on a focus motor in the lens, as I recall.

I use a 5D Mark III, and it works.So this doesn't have IS and what would be only time you would need IS?? Portraits and what else?? and How are 2X extensions on here, good quantity?? You need IS when taking pictures of static object to compensate for movements of your hands. Thus for static objects you can use longer exposures with the IS. However for portraits IS is of little significance, since it does not compensate for movements of the object itself. What is important for the portrait is overall image quality and bokeh - both excellent with this lens.So this doesn't have IS and what would be only time you would need IS?? Portraits and what else?? and How are 2X extensions on here, good quantity?? I don't miss the IS. Uses are pretty much any time you have to slow shutter speed to the point that camera shake is evident. I shoot portraits without IS and I'm very happy. Maybe I have a steady hand but more likely I have adequate settings and lighting. If you don't do any flash photography, or plan to shoot frequently in mostly dimly lit areas, perhaps you will need the IS. Personally, I'm glad I saved the money. I know nothing of the 2x extenders.So this doesn't have IS and what would be only time you would need IS?? Portraits and what else?? and How are 2X extensions on here, good quantity?? Primarily for low light handheld shooting.  If you can afford it, get the IS version, it's not that much more and it's amazing how well it works.  You can always not use the IS if you have it, but not the other way around!So this doesn't have IS and what would be only time you would need IS?? Portraits and what else?? and How are 2X extensions on here, good quantity?? From what I understand the IS feature allows you to shoot \"hands free\".  Of course if you use the lens on a tripod (like I do) if you had IS you would have to turn it off.  This is an amazing lens and definitely my favorite.  For Portraits I would check out the 24-70mm 2.8 IS L Lens.  I have not tried a 2X extension with this lens but at this time I really don't need one.  However, if you are thinking of using 2X extensions, I imagine that you would be shooting with a tripod and would not need the IS feature.Why is this listed as \"old model\" in the title? searching, i see no newer non-is version.

This one is very bulky.How well do the gel pads adhere when you are working outside and start sweating? Not very well. The unit is relatively heavy (not really heavy by itself, but for sticking to your skin it is heavy) so it is better to augment the sticky pad adherence with a clothing waistband.How well do the gel pads adhere when you are working outside and start sweating? This is one of the reasons that I do not like the Hollywog. Because of the weight of it, it has a difficult time sticking even indoors. I have not worn it outdoors because of this reason. It's a poor design. Maybe if you wore something to hold it in place, such as a wide belt, it would work better but I was using it in the middle of my chest.How well do the gel pads adhere when you are working outside and start sweating? You can perform moderate physical activity, however if you sweat significantly it will affect the adhesive properties of the gel pads and you will tend to replace the pads more often.How well do the gel pads adhere when you are working outside and start sweating? I've found that if you put it on when your back is clean and dry, the pads seems to stick pretty well. If you're sweating a TON, they do loosen up a little from your skin.

{"asin": "B0036OR91A", "text": "can the tcd74800 be used with antenna without subscription? No, this unit only works on existing cable services. It basically would replace the set top box that the cable company would rent you.can the tcd74800 be used with antenna without subscription? Hi,Sorry it took so long. Yes a Premiere XL can be used with an antenna. I had contemplated it myself and the TiVo technicians were very helpful.  Your best bet is to call them 877-367-8486.Best reardsKevincan the tcd74800 be used with antenna without subscription? Yes, it will work with antenna; however, you still have to pay for TIVO subscription.Do you need to pay a service to TiVo each month? No you can purchase the lifetime service plan. Not the cheapest but worth it if you plan to use it for a while.Do you need to pay a service to TiVo each month? Yes, they charge monthly fee, I believe $14. Or you can pay for a lifetime subscription, last I looked it was $499.  What you are paying for is the update of the Tivo's channel guide. You can only store 2 weeks worth of guide at a time, so with the subscription it contacts their servers and keeps you up to date with shows coming on.  I love mine, make sure you get the one with the right amount of tuners, meaning  4 tuners=record 4 shows at a time, 2 tuners=record 2 shows at a time.Do you need to pay a service to TiVo each month? Yes there is a monthly charge for tivo.  We have had tivo for years we pay around $12 or so a month.  Hope that helps....Do you need to pay a service to TiVo each month? Yes monthly quarterly and annually choices..also lifetime.. I have an older unit on a lifetime I do not play for that one anymore.What is the size of the hard drive?  Is it one Terrabyte? Do not know.  TIVO rates the size of the hard drive by the number of hours of programming that can be stored.What is the size of the hard drive?  Is it one Terrabyte? I am not exactly sure.  I do know that the Premiere XL4 is 2 Terabytes, so it MAY be that the regular Premiere XL is one Terabyte. However if you want to make sure , you can contact TiVo Tech Support at 877-367-8486 OR Sales Support at 877-289-8486 (877-BUY-TIVO). I hope this helps!What is the size of the hard drive?  Is it one Terrabyte? Don't know. They don't provide that detail.What is the size of the hard drive?  Is it one Terrabyte? I don't know the size, but it will record 150 hours of HD programs.What is the size of the hard drive?  Is it one Terrabyte? Depends what you order. I have one with 2 terrabytes and the other 2 have 1 terrabyte HD.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? Unfortunately it will not.  However if you have a tivo on each you can now stream content from either tivo on each tv.  It is a really nice feature.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? I would suggest another TiVo or refer to TiVo.com about the TiVo set-top that pulls live feeds without conversion. when you get real comfortable I'll bring you up to speed on pytivo and streambaby.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? I'm pretty sure it will not. You can get a card from your cable company to put in the Tivo to have it tune in your channels like your cable box.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? No.  The TiVo and cable box won't interoperate.  If you have two or more TiVo's in your house, then they can see each other, and act as a single multi-room DVR.One other consideration for TiVo: you will not be able to access your cable companies' On Demand programming via the TiVo box.  I felt that the benefits of the TiVo outweighed the On Demand functionality, but it is still something to consider when deciding to purchase a TiVo.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? TiVo Box will NOT connect to a Cable Box. Although a second TiVo Box with a network line (Cat5 or Wireless) will replace the cable box and connect to the other TiVo Boxes on the Network. I record on the main TiVo Box and can watch recorded programs from the second box. With the Computer Program from TiVo I can watch from my PC or a Tablet too. The second TiVo Box shows up on the main display screen and you just 'click' on it to access the stored programs.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? No you cannot. If you have a Tivo Premier on each set you can stream between them. If you have older pre Premier Tivos on each set you can transfer non protected programs between the Tivos. At a minimum this would be broadcast stations and uprotected cable stations. A lot depends on how much your cable provider protects. Premium stations are always protected.If i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? I don't think so, although there might be a tweak or solution.  However, if you have 2 or more Tivo's, you can access each other's recorded content from any of the connected TivoIf i have a TiVo on one TV and a cable box on a second TV, will the TiVo act as a multiroom DVR for the cable box on the second TV? Echo that... you need to connect from one TiVo to another. Sure is nice!How many shows can you record at once? two shows recorded at once and can watch a live show on different channelHow many shows can you record at once? We can record 2 shows at once.

The heating elements themselves do not move closer to the bread/bagels, there are so-called 'clamps' that once the bread is lowered into the toaster, it will close/lock in the bread, from both sides to hold the bread in the middle of the heating elements so that the bread does not lean to one side or the other.  It then releases when toasting is complete and rises to the top.  Personally I think this helps to toast evenly on both sides.Do the heating elements move to adjust for different bread thicknesses? The actual heating elements don't move but the racks that hold the bread in place adjust based on thickness of the bread.Do the heating elements move to adjust for different bread thicknesses? The heating elements do not move but the bread holders do to hold each thickness perfectly.Do the heating elements move to adjust for different bread thicknesses? Yes, they adjust within limits. Half bagels are no problem and the unit toasts perfectly. The add more time feature really helps if you want the bread or bagel toasted more. Also the setting for toasting is very accurate and it will toast the same way every time. We love ours!Do the heating elements move to adjust for different bread thicknesses? Yes, it does. This is a great toaster.Can you turn off the beep at the end of the cycle? No, but it is 1sjort beep. Not bothersome.Can you turn off the beep at the end of the cycle? There is nothing in the owner's manual about turning off the beep. However, it isn't very loud. I doubt it can be heard more than 20 feet away. It beeps for about 1 second tops.Can you turn off the beep at the end of the cycle? I do not see where you could turn the beep off, but the beep only lasts for a nano second, and it is not annoying or loud.  I love this toaster, and it toasts evenly.Can you turn off the beep at the end of the cycle? YES. You can disable the beep by pressing a number of buttons in succession. It IS in the manual.how fast does it toast It depends on the level of darkness. It is fairly quick anyway. It has a feature that allows you to check the progress and a feature that allows for a little more time. As with any new appliance you need to get used to it.how fast does it toast I love this toaster.  It takes about 35 seconds to one minute depending on how dark you want it.how fast does it toast It toasts as fast as any other toaster I have owned. The time is determined by how dark you want the toast to be. There is an indictor that flashes along a bar to allow you to know how close to being finished in the toast cycle. The toaster is silent except that it beeps when the toast is done. I like it a lot.how fast does it toast 2 1/2 minutes for lightly brown toast.... set the timer, not the temperature and you never have to check it.  I am not one to spend $200 bucks on a toaster, but I will have to admit that this toaster is worth every penny... love it!how fast does it toast iif i understand the question, put the bread in - push the button - zip.   2.5 -3 minutes - nice brown.how fast does it toast Set at mid-range (3), it will take just under three minutes to toast.  It is not particularly fast.how long are the slots, will they accommodate artisan breads? 5 1/2 long by 1  1/2 inches. They handle a thicker bagel - if that helps!how long are the slots, will they accommodate artisan breads? The bread slots are 5 1/2\" long by 1 1/2\" wide - measured at the top surface.how long are the slots, will they accommodate artisan breads? Slots are each 5 1/2\" by 1 1/2\"how long are the slots, will they accommodate artisan breads? The toaster that I purchased is the 4 slot, which the slots are about 5 to 5.5 inches long.  Breville does make this toaster with only 2 slots that has longer slots that would accommodate the wider breads or 2 slices of regular sandwich bread in each slot (side by side)..... A great toaster!! worth every pennyhow long does it take to toast  on a medium setting? Just a bit less than 3 minutes.how long does it take to toast  on a medium setting? 2.5 - 3 minhow long does it take to toast  on a medium setting? Faster than you might think...

I use my iPad and cell service for the Internet. There are systems out there for the Internet that I saw starting around $8,000.00. Google RV and the Internet.can i get internet and satellite tv I have Dish satellite tv and this dish works to perfection. I think Dish also offers internet but you would also have to check with them. You can reach them at mydish.com or call Customer Service at 1-800-333-DISH. I use Verizon for my cell phone and internet needs. The SK-1000 is the best one out there IMO.can i get internet and satellite tv I believe Dish Network offers internet via their satellite.  There is ONE BIG however!!  You have to have a dedicated upload link which is NOT the Vangard Traveler.  Something like a telephone land line.  That is something you would not have while traveling in an RV.can i get internet and satellite tv No, you cannot get internet.  It's TV only.  To get internet, you need another type of dish, and it won't receive TV.Can the power box be converted to the RV's 12 volt power system? Hi Russell,You could,but you would have to run 12 volt wire up by the tv and plug the satellite into a converter box. But why do that? You only need the power to lower and raise and you could do,that with your generator.Can the power box be converted to the RV's 12 volt power system? I run mine thru my inverter so that it will work when I am unplugged from shore power. Good  luckCan the power box be converted to the RV's 12 volt power system? We just direct wired it into the 12 volt system and eliminated the power box converter. Just cut the wire off the box and direct wired it into a FUSED CONNECTION. Make sure you fuse protect it. Try 10-15 amps if that doesn't hold then go to 20 amps. Mine works just fine. Powers right up and finds the birds in less than 3-4 minutes. Much better that that Tailgater messCan the power box be converted to the RV's 12 volt power system? I would think that you could splice the wire, but the cord and power adaptor (supplied) is so convenient if you have a 110v rec. nearby.  You will need a rec. to supply your reciever and you will be able to turn your power off once it locks in to sats. installation was easy if you are somewhat mechanical.Can the power box be converted to the RV's 12 volt power system? i do not know.  but wouldn't you still need 110v for your tv(s)?Can the power box be converted to the RV's 12 volt power system? The system (and control box) uses 48 VDC so that's not an easy conversion to make from 12 volts. A small inverter would probably be a better solution since the antenna only needs power when raising and stowing.of what material is the dish made ?? carbon fiber or other material ?
