Choosing the best universal microphone shock mount is interesting because most microphone brands offer their own compatible shock mounts that are designed to perfectly fit the microphone they are designed for. In some cases, they don't offer a compatible shock mount, which is a great reason to get a universal one. Phantom power, commonly designated as +48V or P48, was designed to power microphones without using bulky external power supplies such as the ones required for tube microphones. It's most widely used as a power source for condenser microphones, which have active electronics. Be sure to verify whether your microphone is a condenser type or another type such as dynamic or ribbon. If it is a condenser microphone it will need phantom power, if it is a different type of microphone it will not."

There is a spine along the side with the smart connector that can be removed, leaving a perfect opening for a Smart Cover or Smart Keyboard. The spine is removable which allows easy attachment for Smart Cover or Keyboard. With this new Google Photos update, you can now add portrait mode to any photo. Most recent iPhones and Androids have portrait mode, which blurs the background and focuses on the subject, making the photo looks like it was taken with a high-end DSLR camera. It is not possible for the Ipad to stand vertically with this case because of its long sides. Good quality leather always has quality stitching to match. Flaws in stitching, hardware, and lining can indicate inferior leather quality. Pay close attention to how it feels and looks, if it feels wrong it probably is. To look for your device model number, just open settings and tap about. You can find the model number in the top section. If the number you see contains a slash \"/\" that's the part number, just tap the part number to reveal the model number, which contailns letters followed by four number and no slash."

The co2 slides in and is capped in place by a threaded screw cap. The CO2 leak down if not used and is not shot for a few days It takes a matter of years for the gaskets to break down, not days. The standard cartridges are fine. You will only get 60 shots less if using a dilencer before accuracy becomes an issue. The 2240 is .22 caliber. It will take out a rat at very close range if you hit it right.']",
        "ref": "The CO2 cartridge will maintain pressure for approximately sixty shots but after a while before accuracy becomes an issue. The CO2 cartridge slides into place and is capped by a threaded screw cap. A silencer could be fitted to this gun with an adapter, as the product has a hole to replace the sight. Fitting a silencer would reduce the number of shots per canister to thirty before the pellet begins to dip. The 2240 is .22 caliber and cannot take .177 BBs. This product can take down squirrels at very close range with fresh CO2. The product does not have enough power for successful longer range shots at squirrels."

It adds a bit of illumination when there is insufficient ambient light for the scope to work properly. It gives more light to the target for more brightness and clarity. The optics is Starlight - light gathering, the top horn shaped lens is an infrared light magnifier. The zoom is not adjustable and is set for 5x magnification but is possible to see up close (5-10 feet away) without a problem.']",
        "ref": "The unit comes with one infrared LED that can be switched on and off separately from the scope. This product cannot take pictures or video it is only used to see in dark conditions. This product isn't waterproof, and sadly there isn't a place to screw in a tripod mount. The lenses are glass and the case is plastic. This product functions well at night within 100 yards with no issues seeing 5-10 feet up close. This product comes with a lens cap however there isn't a case and has a one year warranty."
