This product is a co2 cartridge that is sealed by an o ring connection. The co2 slides in and is capped in place by a threaded screw cap. The standard cartridges are fine. The CO2 leaks down if not used and is not shot for a few days. The product can take out a rat easily up to 25 years. The adapter will need to be fitted to screw the silencer onto and remove the front sight. The pellet will dip in transit. The rat would blow a hole right through the gun.
This product has an infrared LED that is switched separately from the scope itself. The optics are Starlight - light gathering, the top horn shaped lens is an in-frare - magnifier. It gives more light to the target for more brightness and clarity. The zoom is not adjustable and is set for 5x magnification but it is possible to see up close (5-10 feet away) without a problem. The body of the monocular is soft rubber plastic, however, the actual night vision crystals inside the device are glass, as well as the objective/ocular lenses.
