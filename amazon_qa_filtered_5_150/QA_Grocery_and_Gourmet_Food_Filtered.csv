Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B001GE8N4Y,does this item have alcohol in it?,"Almost all extracts contain alcohol. They do not put it in for their benefit, as it obviously costs more than water! The reason that almost all extracts use alcohol is that some flavors simply don't dissolve in water, so if you soak vanilla beans in just water, you are not getting some of the many flavor compounds out of the beans. Same with cooking, alcohol dissolves some flavors that water alone will not, so many recipes call for a little alcohol to 'carry' the flavors."

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B001GE8N4Y,"Extract vs. Paste? Shelf life, taste, smoothies and alcohol content? Is alcohol steady at 30% for paste regardless ... for flavor priority?","Depends on the use. shelf life is the same, alcohol content is the same and as far as taste the paste is a little more assertive because it has those wonderful vanilla flecks of the inside of the vanilla beans. If your making pastry cream, creme caramel, some type of frosting etc vanilla bean paste is your best bet."

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000216AEC,Is it white rice or brown rice,"Sweet rice flour is white and has a much higher starch content than ""regular"" rice flour because it's ground from short-grain glutinous (sticky) rice.

Think of it like texturing a wall or flocking a Christmas tree.  :) So the genetics are never messed with, but it is modified to create an instant much like dried milk or other instant products."

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B0000CFLCT,Can you control the strength of the coffee by adjusting the rate of flow? Or using more coffee grounds?,"Yes to both. You can make the coffee stronger by using more coffee grinds, a finer grind, hotter water, less water, slower pour, or a longer exposure. Essentially the heat of the water and the length of exposure and the amount of coffee grinds all determine how much off the coffee oils can be drawn out of the beans. So, for example, fine grounds have more surface area than the same amount of coarse ground coffee. This means more of it is exposed to the water and more of the oils that make up coffee can be drawn out making a stronger cup of coffee."

The upper limit is 0.3 mcg/gram (0.3 ppm).  This is over 3 times the limit.  One serving is 14 grams, not 26 pounds.

A 1-pound bag of the powder contains about 454*0.95, or about 430, mcg of cadmium. Divide that by the number of days it takes you to go through such a 1lb. bag to get your average daily cadmium intake from the cocoa.

Since this is a natural product, no ""hydrogenated fats"" or chemicals to keep it mixed, you simply have to shake it vigorously before each use. It tastes great, better than most bottled products, and you can use a very high quality virgin olive oil and vinegar for the mix, keeping it delicious, healthful and gourmet."
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B001EQ4DNY,why does the mix stay at the bottom of the cruet and not mix with the oil,Try mixing the 'mix' with the vinegar and water first. Let it sit to allow the vinegar and water to 'hydrate' the mix. THEN add the oil. Seems to really help.

The only way to buy true raw almonds is to find a farmer to buy from or buy imported raw almonds from Europe (they do not have almond pasteurizing laws).  They are a bit more expensive, but worth it to some."
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B001ESHOA6,"Are these almonds pasteurized, and if so what method?  Thank you!",They are not raw if they are pasteurized.  So Amazon needs to be clear on this and not state they are raw or someone should sue them.

If you like it sweeter add stevia extract. Coconut milk is high in medium chain fatty acids, making it easier to utilize fat burning in your body. It will not raise your boos sugar."
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B003JO0VV2,what is the carb content in Kefir?,The kefir grains themselves are bacteria and yeast. looking up yeast online it is mostly protein In a ratio of 8 grams protein to 5 grams carbohydrate (4 grams fiber 1 gram sugar). One cup of whole milk (which is the recommended milk if you're going to get a good growth of your grains) has 11 g of carbs and about 8 grams each of protein and fat.
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B003JO0VV2,what is the carb content in Kefir?,"The carb content of kefir is going to be whatever the carb content of the milk is that you used to make it. The sugars in the milk turn into bacteria and yeasts, which are technically counted as carbs, but they don't metabolize the same way that sugars do."
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B003JO0VV2,what is the carb content in Kefir?,That is an impossible question to answer. The kefir itself has no carbs. So the carb content depends on how long you leave it in the milk how much fat is in the milk to begin with and how much milk you use. The kefir lives off of the fat in the milk. By consuming the fat it lowers the carb count. It converts the fat to probiotics. Think of it like photosynthesis. Plants turn carbon dioxide into oxygen the more plants the more oxygen. Kefir converts the fat to probiotics the more kefir and the longer it sits the less fat. So therefore less carbs.
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B003JO0VV2,Can these be used to make coconut water kefir?,Water kefir grains might be a better choice.

Erythritol is not metabolized by the body so it has zero calories. It is also not metabolized by gut bacteria so it does not cause gas like Sorbitol or Xylitol. Erythritol occurs naturally in fruits. The Erythritol in Swerve is made by fermenting glucose. It is a safe no-calorie alternative to sugar that tastes much better than any artificial sweetener on the market."

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B0052Z92WA,i want this for a christmas gift---wil it be good for that long,"If you mean you want to buy now and not give the mushroom kit until Christmas - the answer is for sure yes.  The kit does not become active until you follow directions open, soak, and mist your mushrooms-to-be.  A major impact on long it takes for the mushrooms to grow to maturity is TEMPERATURE and, if in a dry environment then mist a lot, Humidity.  Warmer/moist = fast : Cooler/dryer = slower.   Good Luck"

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000E5SGI4,Is the truffle flavor naturally extracted or artificially produced?,"Most of the truffle flavor you taste is artificial.

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EF3E2W,"What makes the natural ones more expensive than the ""unnatural"" ones?","The key to sardines is that the best ones are wild-caught and Brisling type sardines. Sardines is a term that applies to many different actual fish. The generally accepted most prized/delicious ones are the smallest, called Brisling sardines. They tend to have better flavor and better health profiles overall, and the price matches. Additionally, they usually come from responsible, sustainable fisheries in the Scandinavia or Northern/Western Europe area rather than being low-quality, farmed or over-fished large ""sardines"" you can buy for $0.59 a tin."
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EF3E2W,"What makes the natural ones more expensive than the ""unnatural"" ones?",each sardine is uniform in size and the best oil is used in the process.
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EF3E2W,"What makes the natural ones more expensive than the ""unnatural"" ones?",If you look closely at the two products you will notice the natural ones are advertised as bpa free. It has to do with the lining of the steel can they are packed in. If you are unaware of bpa can liners you could easily miss this. Google it.
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EF3E2W,"Do these come with bones, skin, head, or tail attached?","Howdy.  As with most teeny sardines, they have bones, skin, and tail.  The fish entrails are removed, though, and the heads are cut off.  One can barely notice the bones, which dissolve because they're so small."

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EICPAG,Does this sauce contain gluten or MSG?,Yes it contains MSG .. Fish sauce is made of anchovies (like the roman garum) fermented in a salt brine.. which yields MSG

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EICPAG,Is this good sauce for salmon?,Absolutely not!!! It will take away the delicate flavor of the Salmon away and infuse with that of anchovies and other fishes used to make this sauce.
