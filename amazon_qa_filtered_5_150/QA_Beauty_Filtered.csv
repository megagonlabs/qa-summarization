Beauty,B006HKR6OK,What does soak off gel lacquer in the product description mean? Would typical nail polish remover work?,"Soak off means you have to use asatone to remove it, regular remover won't work,"
Beauty,B006HKR6OK,What does soak off gel lacquer in the product description mean? Would typical nail polish remover work?,"No.  This is a gel system.  You need a UV lamp to cure it, it requires a cured top coat and is removed by soaking in pure acetone."
Beauty,B006HKR6OK,"Does this polish work well with a UV lamp? If so, how long does it usually take to cure?","Yes, all OPI is curable with a  UV lamp. The base coat cures is 1 min."
Beauty,B006HKR6OK,"Does this polish work well with a UV lamp? If so, how long does it usually take to cure?","you have to have a uv lamp, apply base coat put under light 30 seconds, every coat after that including top coat 3 minutes under lamp separately, finish with alcohol to cure it"
Beauty,B006HKR6OK,"Does this polish work well with a UV lamp? If so, how long does it usually take to cure?",this is the base coat so no. You put the base coat on and then a color and then use a uv lamp for 120 seconds and then the top coat and another 120 seconds of uv light and then wipe with a cottonball and alcohol and you are good to go.
Beauty,B006HKR6OK,What is the difference between shellac and gel?,"Besides being a different product, the idea of each is similar.  Both are long lasting and cure quickly, gel is more durable, shellac is smoother.  The main difference is the light used to cure the product.  Shellac requires a UV light, while gel uses an LCD light.  Most people agree LCD is safer to use.  Personal preference is the main difference."
Beauty,B006HKR6OK,What is the difference between shellac and gel?,"the gel, is a colored ""gel"" (that looks like nail polish), ""Shellac"" is a technology invented by Creative Nail Design, is similar to a gel manicure in that it also uses UV light to cure each coat but the Shellac takes about a third of the time to soak off."
Beauty,B006IBM21K,Will this UV light also cure LED polish?,"There is no such thing as ""LED polish"".  Some UV lamps are powered by LED lights, while others are incandescent or fluorescent.  LED merely indicates the type of lightbulb used in the lamp.  However, LED lights will cure nails much faster."
Beauty,B006IBM21K,"how about using a regular nail poliish and applying a clear gel coat over the top, will this still work?","They call this a ""gelly sandwich"". A gelly sandwich is when you use shellac or gel polish base coat, regular nail polish, and shellac top coat. It will ""work"" but it won't last as long. To do a gelly sandwich, you'll have to apply the shellac base coat, cure for 10 seconds or whatever your gel base coat instruction says; apply regular nail polish (but the uv light doesn't dry regular polish. However, you can use the fan.); after the regular polish has dried, apply your gel top coat and cure for two minutes."
Beauty,B006IBM21K,"how about using a regular nail poliish and applying a clear gel coat over the top, will this still work?","Yes, if you are using regular nail polish with gel top coat, it still works great! Only recommendation is to let the regular nail polish dry COMPLETELY before adding the gel top coat. If you don't, the regular nail polish will begin to wrinkle."
Beauty,B006IBM21K,"how about using a regular nail poliish and applying a clear gel coat over the top, will this still work?",Yes. Follow the directions for how long to cure.
Beauty,B006IBM21K,what is the fan for?,For drying natural polish on nail or toes
Beauty,B006IBM21K,what is the fan for?,To keep your hands cool. The lights can get warm(not HOT but warm). It is not intended to dry regular wet nail polish.
Beauty,B006IBM21K,"Hi!  How long is the curing time for the base, each coat polish, and the top coat?","It depends on the brand of polish.  For the shellac top and base coat, it's ten seconds and the color is 90 seconds.  Each bottle of polish comes with their recommended curing time."
Beauty,B006IBM21K,"Hi!  How long is the curing time for the base, each coat polish, and the top coat?","2 min. each coat. If you have 1 base coat, 2 polish coats & 1 top coat it will take 8 min."
Beauty,B006IBM21K,Will it work with Regular nail polish?,"Not sure, Haven't tried regular polish yet, just the shellac"
Beauty,B006IBM21K,When do you use the fan?,"Turn on when ever you use lamp. The lights get hot and it keeps the housing cool,preventing over heating. Use the gloves they offer. To prevent exposure to UV . Hopes this helps"

Beauty,B00BT7VOI0,why i feel the hot wind is so hot...can't bear....is that i need a adapter? (use it in USA),"The hair dryer is only meant to run on 100v. The US's voltage is 120v, meaning that the hair dryer is being supplied with 20% more voltage. As a result of the increase in voltage, the hair dryer will consume 44% more power and get 44% hotter. This is dangerous so please buy a transformer with a higher wattage (2000 watt - 3000 watt). The hair dryer uses 1200w so do not be cheap and try to buy a 500 watt or 1000 watt transformer; the fuse will blow out when you turn on the hair dryer."

Beauty,B0002M6ZLY,"Anyone else have problems with the table just coming apart? the hardware under the table top tore through the ""legs"" as they are just press board.","So far, no. But it will depend on how tight the installer made the bolts originally---you cannot over-tighten those things. Being press-board, the wood just does not hold well. And it depends on how rough the kids treat the table. You can always get the  ""real"" thing---wood--- but you pay more than double. Press-board is just chips of wood glued together and it does come apart over time---damn Asian crap."

Beauty,B000BPT0TG,The front of the bottle says rinse in and shampoo out.  The directions on back say apply to hair after shampooing and dry  hair with dryer.  Which ?,That means that when you shampoo your hair the color will come out of you hair. It is not a permanent hair color.  Follow the directions.

If its anything else it will probably turn your hair a blue shade. It will work best on yellow-white hair to turn it more white.

Beauty,B000CSYYZM,"If you have highlighted hair, can you use this all over your hair without the un-highlighted part getting lighter?","No, if you use as directed with developer, it will get all lighter, maybe not as light as the highlighted part.

Beauty,B000CSYYZM,"If you have highlighted hair, can you use this all over your hair without the un-highlighted part getting lighter?","The hair that had not been bleached won't get lighter, but it will tone it. For example, if your highlights are getting brassy, you can use ""White Lady"" to take the brassy color out, but the other hair is brown, it will pull some of the warmth out of it. Hope that helps!"

You can however, use your soft cup, at a light suction, next to the veins to relieve the pressure causing fluids and drain your lymphatic system to prevent fluid build-up. Just be sure to never go directly over the varicose vein as this can lead to damage. The cups can be used over Spider Veins, the thin broken capillaries usually in a spiderweb-like formation. Happy Cupping!"

Repeat for the other hand.

Pleasant tasting so go directly into your mouth, no mixing or fuss! The dosage is always smaller in liquid because the body can assimilate all of it.

Beauty,B000A409J8,Is this bad for your hair?,"Using any type of bleach can ruin hair but, if you start with virgin hair or rarely use chemicals or heat, there is less damage. Otherwise, hair that is already dry and brittle will just worsen and may break off. Additionally, make sure you have the right information if you're bleaching hair at home as doing it wrong can also lead to damage or unexpected results."
Beauty,B000A409J8,Is this bad for your hair?,"Absolutely... BUT all lighteners cause some damage, and doing it yourself is (of course) riskier than paying a professional. Ask yourself: in a worse case scenario, how much would it bother you to loose a couple inches from the ends of your hair? Unless the answer is 'not much', you'd be better off going to a pro. On the other hand, if you are the adventurous type, this tub and a couple bottles of developer will cost less than one salon visit and keep your hair very blond for 6 months or more."

To achieve the type of texture that would compel users to reapply! http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/ask-the-experts/does-a-higher-spf-sunscreen-always-protect-your-skin-better"
Beauty,B000Q37M5M,Do you have to wear a hair net while under this? Or can you just sit right under it with wet hair?,You can just sit under the dryer you could use a net but it is soley at your discretion
Beauty,B000Q37M5M,is it functional for long hair? mid-back wavy hair or does it dry just the top of the head?,The shields attached to the dryer are moveable and can be angled to hit that longer hair. The dryer blower is powerful enough that the air blows down well.

Beauty,B000Q37M5M,what is the noise level?,"From the outside, it's very quiet. Inside, it's a tad less than a blow dryer. It depends on the speed."
Beauty,B000Q37M5M,what is the noise level?,"Noise level average for a dryer, but not even heat, waste of money"

Beauty,B000RBMGMW,is this builder gel?,"No its not builder gel, this is more for natural nail overlays, or used as top coat for acrylics nails. Builder gel is more for acrylic overlays, or used with forms to sculpt the gel."
Beauty,B000RBMGMW,is this builder gel?,"If you mean does it require other layers, then no, it can be used alone. It is better if you use a gel nail primer first. But the IBD nail gel is good on its own.  You just use rubbing alcohol after to remove stickiness. And of course you need a UV light to cure it.  IBD is great stuff especially for people who have weak or thin nails.  Nail tips can be a big help in getting a good shape started."
Beauty,B000RBMGMW,is this builder gel?,"No, it is the finisher.  Once you have created your design and applied jewels or whatever else, you apply it on top to seal the design and any ornaments for a clear gloss glasslike finish that saves the life of the polish and nail."

Beauty,B000RBMGMW,Can you do regular nail polish designs on top of it? and if you mess up can you clean it off with acetone and restart or will it not come off?,Yes you can. This gel only comes off with filing. Acetone does not take it off
Beauty,B000RBMGMW,Can this product be used on top of regular nail polish in order to extend the life and prevent chipping?,"It doesn't always work, and you need a lot of patience to get it right. With a regular manicure, your drying time at the salon is about 20 minutes, but it actually takes 24 hours for the solvents in regular polish to fully dry. If the solvents aren't fully dry, then putting on a gel topcoat is going to seal in wet polish. Or the topcoat could just slip right off."
Beauty,B000RY6ZXU,Is the consistency of this product a little like egg whites? Does it crack or dissolve when you put liquid makeup on?,"It somehow disolves if the makeup product is too liquid as it is like washing your face, any cream would dissolve. The make up should be just not too liquid."

No lemon juice or anything citric, as you would use with henna."
Beauty,B004IUN7JO,If you use this by itself without the henna will the result be blue?,"Yes!   You have to do the henna first.   Leave it on for about 2-4 hours and then apply indigo to rinsed hair.

Once it dries it no longer deposits color."

Beauty,B003EYNA06,what is the weight of the mirror and frame?,2lbs or less its really very light
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,"No. It is a fixed installation height. You determine the height. However, the mirror does swivel so it can tilt up or down to a certain degree."
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,"No, other than adjusting the tilt of the mirror itself. The arm is fixed in place."
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,No.  Arm swings out so that a person does not have to lean forward but that is a horizontal swivel.  There is no vertical movement by arm.  The mirror itself swivels so that a taller person could tilt mirror up and look down into mirror.  A shorter person could tilt mirror down and look up into mirror.
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,It is very flexible but only at the height you choose.
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,The mirror tilts up and down so yes it can face any angle... but it doesn't slide up and down a track if that is what you are wondering.
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,It does not go up and down on the wall bracket.  The mirror itself will tip upwards and downwards as it does at total flip from one side to the other in order to use as a regular mirror and a magnified mirror.  Sounds like you would have to mount for the tall person and hope the downward tipping will do the the shorter person.
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,Yes the mirror tilts up or down. Plus you could mount it on wall a little lower.
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Does this mirror adjust such that it can be used by tall and short persons?,No you would have to position it on the wall for your height. It reaches straight out towards you but the mirror only swivels up an down so it won't adjust to short or tall.
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Can you tighten the mirror itself so it stays relatively fixed and does not flip over to the magnified side?,"It's supposed to flip and swivel, but it should not do so by itself. If it's turning by itself, you can tighten the thumbscrews on the sides."
Beauty,B003EYNA06,Can you tighten the mirror itself so it stays relatively fixed and does not flip over to the magnified side?,Yes there are screws either side that you can tighten.

Beauty,B003GVCU62,is it a styling gel?,No this is NOT a staying gel! It is used after your hair is dried and you only need a small amount to work into your hair. It is for shine and control if you have some fly away ends or frizz it will give your hair more control and add shine without the stiffness of a gel.
Beauty,B003GVCU62,What does it smell like?,It's hard to describe. It's not really strong. It's smells clean and barely flowery. You really have to use a ton or get real close to smell anything.
Beauty,B003GVCU62,Why is the packaging different? It doesn't look like this on the TIGI website.  Is this product a knock off?,"If it says Bed Head, it's not a knock off, perhaps a change in packaging colors"

Beauty,B004KPYWM8,product says to first apply toner and emulsion...what emulsion are they referring to?,"In Korean skincare, an emulsion is their terminology for a lotion version of a moisturizer, as opposed to a crean.

Beauty,B004KPYWM8,product says to first apply toner and emulsion...what emulsion are they referring to?,You all can refer to the U.S. Laneige website to know how to use the products in the right order. Hope this is helpful to those who are new to Korean skin care products http://www.us.laneige.com
Beauty,B004KPYWM8,How long did shipping take? What differences did you see in your skin with this product?,"It can take a couple of weeks if you're ordering from a company in So. Korea, but Target stores (brick & mortar and online) are carrying Laneige products now so that's an option for getting it quicker.  The sleeping mask is only recommended to use a couple of times a week.  It is lightweight and gives a veil of ingredients over the face rather than a heavy cream.  In the morning, the skin is plump and hydrated without feeling greasy."
Beauty,B004KPYWM8,"do you have to be caucasian or fair skin to use this product, does it really whiten your skin?","In Asian skincare, when it says 'whitening' it really means 'brightening'. The claim is that the product improves sun-damage and/or hyperpigmentation, but even the most effective 'whitening' products will not lighten your skin lighter than your actual skin color. That of the areas of your body not exposed to the sun (such as your stomach, etc...)."

What is the builder gel used for and what is the regular clear gel used for?,"The Builder gel is more thick in consistency, so if a client has thin nails and the arch has been filed out you can use this as a builder but you still must use the foundation as the base, and the clear gel is just like a laminated coating not as think in consistency. There is also a structure gel that is thick as well and can build a thin and fragile nail.I hope this answers your inquiry.  Namaste~"
