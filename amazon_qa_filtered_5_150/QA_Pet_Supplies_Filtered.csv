Pet_Supplies,B000YIWT0M,Are the carbon pellets useful for airborne orders (like litter boxes)?,"It is activated carbon, so yes, it will remove many odors from the air, including the ammonia that gasses off of litter boxes.  The problem is that the air you wish to filter must pass over the carbon (or any other filter media) for it to be filtered.  So unless you're employing a ventilation filtration system of some sort, nothing will really be effective to completely eliminate an airborne odor, because not all of the air will reach the media."

Pet_Supplies,B000YIWT0M,is this ok for turtles?,Yes. They shouldnt be able to get to it. However even if they eat it its not going to hurt them.

Id just run straight filter fluff. But if you must then yes its safe theyll be fine.

Pet_Supplies,B001QC9DTU,What size batteries does it take?,"Hi! It takes 2 CR2016 watch batteries. You can find them by the cameras or jewelry section.

Pet_Supplies,B001QC9DTU,Can anyone explain how to remove the batteries?,"Use a screwdriver to pry out the plug.  The ball is near indestructible, but the inner works are not, so when you get your tip under the edge of the plug, be careful of the innards which consist of a clear plastic sleeve containing a one piece battery compartment and light.  There is a flimsy rubber band which almost never survives, but it's nonessential to the ball.  Push the old batteries out of the compartment.  Insert your new ones, reseat the innards in the plastic sleeve, and the sleeve in the ball.  Work the plug back into position and you're ready to go."

It does connect to your waste water piping so your fecal waste is already in that system."
Pet_Supplies,B0020N940C,Are there any issues with smell?,No.  As long as you run some water in the septic tank after you put the waste in.  It is capped off so its not open.  You will smell an odor every time you open the cap as you are opening your septic tank but it is not there all the time.

Pet_Supplies,B00251GJ5W,Does this product also remove the stain that you can see under a urine-finder black light?,"This is what the Natures Miracle folks say, ""Unfortunately the stains will always show with a black light.

The pen is plenty big enough for two cats."

Pet_Supplies,B002M79CJE,Do you have to attach the felt pad by yourself? Is there a replacement pad for it? Will it hold 17lbs cat jumping if mounted in drywall only?

Pet_Supplies,B002QXN1HI,"Does this have an internal thermostat to turn the heater off when ""its warm""?  If so, what is the turn off temperature?","Adding one comment to the earlier answer.  If your water level gets low (this is a fairly tall heater so you should never go below about 6"" of water) and the outside temp is low, there is no safety turnoff.  So if it's 30 out and the livestock drink the tank down to a couple inches of water, the heater will glow red until you add water.  Not a problem with the product since it can't tell if it is surrounded by cold water or air, just a tip to keep the water at a minimum depth so you don't waste power."
Pet_Supplies,B002QXN1HI,"How long is the power cord?  Does it have a plug, or must it be hardwired to power source?",Yes it comes with a plug pre wired and its 6' long with a nice clip for the tank. !!All automatic Aaa+**

Pet_Supplies,B002QXN1HI,can this heater heat up 180 gallons of water to about 75 degrees and keep it there for about an hour? if not then can someone please recommend one?,This heater is not made for heating to a certain temperature and maintaining it.  It simply comes on when animal water troughs get close to freezing and the heat it produces keeps at least some of the surface open for drinking purposes.  It might be better to look for an aquarium heater or a spa heater depending upon the use you have for your 180 gallons.

Pet_Supplies,B002RT8M84,i read a review that said you had to push the spring to get it to fill up the bowl?  is this correct?  i wanted something that was automatic,You dont have to push a spring. The device has a spring on the bottom of the reservoir that automatically releases more water as your dog drinks.
Pet_Supplies,B002RT8M84,i read a review that said you had to push the spring to get it to fill up the bowl?  is this correct?  i wanted something that was automatic,Once the upper water part is put in place on the bowl the spring is automatically pushed in and it fills the bowl with water to a certain level.
Pet_Supplies,B002RT8M84,i read a review that said you had to push the spring to get it to fill up the bowl?  is this correct?  i wanted something that was automatic,"It fills the steel bowl automatically. The weight of the water holder pushes down the spring. When you lift the water holder out of the steel pan, the spring disengages and keeps the water from running on the floor. It is a nice watered."
Pet_Supplies,B002RT8M84,i read a review that said you had to push the spring to get it to fill up the bowl?  is this correct?  i wanted something that was automatic,"No, water comes out by itself,it's just a spring under the white part that allows water not to spill. It sort of serves as a stopper/ water suspension regulator. Hope it's clear. No, you don't have to push anything other than fill up the white container with the spring on the bottom of it and put it on top of drinking part."
Pet_Supplies,B002RT8M84,i read a review that said you had to push the spring to get it to fill up the bowl?  is this correct?  i wanted something that was automatic,The bowl is shaped so that as you turn the reservoir to lock it in place the spring is pushed up. As you unlock it the spring uncoils again to allow the plunger to block the hole so no spillage. Works like a cam.
Pet_Supplies,B002RT8M84,How do you go about cleaning the reservoir?  It appears that the top part unscrews.  Can you fit your hand in the reservoir to do a thorough cleaning?,"They also come in varying sizes so that might change access by hand, others mentioned no problems but size might factor in."

Pet_Supplies,B008986EQO,It is running quietly but not pulling in any water.  Blue button is not doing anything either.  What could be the problem,"it is not pulling in water because it has to be filled by water before the pump can work properly. the blue button is there so you can fill the filter with water manually and then turn it on. you have to attach the filter and then start pushing on the blue button fast and multiple times, it is like a manual pump, then when water starts flowing in the filter and fills it up you can turn the filter on."

Pet_Supplies,B0036H0CL6,Can the drip rate be controlled?,Yes. The drip rate can be controlled. There is a sensitive switch for that. IT takes a little patience but it is well worth it
Pet_Supplies,B0036H0CL6,Can the drip rate be controlled?,"Yes, if you look in the zoomed picture you can see the black thing with the white line, that is the control/flow valve that allows to adjust the drip."

Pet_Supplies,B0036H0CL6,"Does the set-up come with everything needed, or is an extension cord needed for the plug? How far from unit does plug extend if there is one?",More than likely you will need an extension cord. How close you are to an outlet will determine its length. An all weather one is preferable.

Measure the interior height and width just behind your vehicle's back seat headrests and compare. Make sure that your headrests look something like the ones in the illustration because the barrier attaches to the metal uprights that support the headrests."

Pet_Supplies,B007CC6W92,"Is this pad holder secure enough to prevent the dog from pulling it out and ripping the pads to shreds, thus preventing a floor mess","If the pad is placed under the mesh grate fully (with no edges sticking out).  Even if an edge was out (either because it was put in crooked or too large for the box), it cannot be easily pulled out from under the grate.  It is very study."
Pet_Supplies,B007CC6W92,does this really hold the pads cause ive yet to find one that does.,for the most part it depends on the pads...name brand pads usually fit three of the four sides. the no name brands seem to fit better and fit all four sides

Pet_Supplies,B007GCGTPU,can a heater tube be put in here...will i have to keep the cover off and if so will the lights still be nice looking and working,a small under gravel heater would be all you needed for this tiny thing.

Pet_Supplies,B007NFNSJ0,How well does the remote maintain connectivity with the collar?  Do you have to constantly link after extended periods of use?,"Excellent question!

The action of the rising air bubbles through the clear plastic tube draws water into the sponge filter. Those same bubbles can add to the oxygen content of the water. The bulk of the O2 in the water will be caused as the bubble break the surface of the water, as it is with any air stone.

Pet_Supplies,B00HBTC4UC,"is it a hybrid or ""genetically modified""?","Jamie is correct, the blue color is completely natural and breeds true.  It occurs in wild populations but is lousy camouflage which is probably why browns and reds are more common.   Captive breeders have worked to intensify and improve the color by selective breeding of the best colored specimens.  Both P. Alleni (a Florida species) and P. Clarkii (a larger Louisiana species) are commonly sold in pet shops and both occur in blue form with P. Alleni most commonly sold as the ""Electric Blue"".  Orange and white crayfish in shops are most often (but not always) P. Clarkii."

The benefit is that if someone finds your pet and brings it to a vet, the vet can scan the chip and quickly look up your contact info.

You can't track your pet in the sense that it doesn't have a GPS locator, but it comes in handy if someone steals your pet and tries to take it to the vet, or if it turns up in a shelter, so the person who scans it knows who to contact to return your pet to you. You do have to register the chip online and pay a fee to the company that collects the info to provide it to anyone who scans it though."
Pet_Supplies,B0002YFROI,How do you track your dog with this chip?,"Most veterinarians and shelters carry a reader that gives them the ""code "" contained in the chip once they scan your dog.

Your main problem with using this solid bottom (heavy plastic) cage is that due to solid bottom You will have to clean it 2 to 3 times a week (alot of work), which is why most bunny cages have a wire bottom (less cleaning).

   Re: Cool Pet III water cool mattress , large;  Drained much water out to enable relocation.  Inner mattress bunched.  Want to refill and use ASAP.  How to remove bunch or does it do so when filled ? John",Once the inner core bunches up it is very difficult to straighten it back out. It is like trying to straighten out a comforter inside a duvet cover. But it is not impossible. You just have to work the core back out into the corners. There really is no quick fix to this. Just be patient and persevere. Work it back out from the center.

Pet_Supplies,B000AL5C1Q,Will the cats sharp claws rip the mesh screen?,It's fabric screen not like window screen that they easily claw through. So i don't think so.
Pet_Supplies,B000AL5C1Q,"Has anyone had any issues with fleas, when allowing their cats to be outdoors in the funhouse?","Fleas need a host. They don't just live in the grass. They also don't have wings. So whether your cat is in the funhouse or not, they would need to be in close prolonged contact with a host animal, in order to contract fleas.  It's possible your cats could contract some other parasite such as heart worm which comes from mosquitos.  But even that seems extremely unlikely.  The mosquitos would have to work their way through the mesh and then through the cats fur to bite the cat's skin.  Most likely the mosquito could find an easier target."

Pet_Supplies,B0017L7U40,how does it turn on/off?  does it automatically drip when the dog licks it?,"It's works similar to a water bottle you would find in a hamster cage.

Pet_Supplies,B0017L7U40,how does it turn on/off?  does it automatically drip when the dog licks it?,It's actually pretty cool! The water only flows when your dog licks it. You will have to teach your dog how to use it. It is very easy to install too.

Or,  pull both ends of one end at the same time.  Each side of each end arm moves separately.   Try the side without the switch first.   That's easier to work with.   Be firm,  but gentle.  Good luck!"

This means you can use the timer mode to allow any cat (or other animal!) in or out at selected hours, without requiring any of the cats to have an ID tag or microchip. This has worked for us for 3 years with no apparent problems."

Also, if it does fit, you will need to figure out how to get the bottle stay in the bracket, maybe by using a rubber band or a plastic wire tie."
Pet_Supplies,B009SM4OK8,Does this stand accommodate the 32 oz. GLASS lixit bottle?,Yes but the large bottle of smart water workers better
Pet_Supplies,B009SM4OK8,Do you think a 75 lb dog will be able to drink from the tallest setting?  Or still too short?  Can another bottle be attached on the back?,No. You would have to place the stand on a box to raise it up.

Pet_Supplies,B009UWMLC4,Does the box come with any liners?,"The liners that come with the box (2 or 3) are made of treated cardboard. The surface in contact with the litter is meant to be ""waterproof"" but it does not stay that way. Consequently, it degrades and it is much more messy to dispose of and keep the box clean. If you search the reviews, some users will say that they do not bother to use the liners, because of this problem, and because the interior of the box is so smooth and well-made, and therefore very easy to clean."
Pet_Supplies,B009VNMP50,"how big is this, as in the ounce capacity of the bowl?  i have a big dog and would like to know if it will hold enough","It holds about 48oz, 6 cups."

Pet_Supplies,B003I5UC0W,Is there a disadvantage of using 300w for a 60g tank?,"Oversized heaters can move the temp too fast which is not good for fish.  Plus if it ever hangs up it will overheat your aquarium so fast that there is no chance you will catch it in time, though heaters never go out or hang up at a convenient time.  That being said these are top notch heaters."
Pet_Supplies,B003I5UC0W,Is there a disadvantage of using 300w for a 60g tank?,As far as wattage there is no disadvantage but the only thing you would need to ensure is that the higher wattage heater will physically fit in the aquarium.  Higher wattage heater typically means a longer heater.
Pet_Supplies,B003I5UC0W,might 3 of these heat an 800 gallon aquaponic system in a greenhouse or is there a better way,pretty sure it will do the trick. Go with 4 and make sure you have some power heads in there to move the water around a little

Pet_Supplies,B007Y5Z5OU,Would it be useful when just on the seat vs. on the console?  Can it be strapped if on the seat?,"No, this console pet car seat should not be used on the seat as there is no way to secure it to the seat."

It makes the maintenance of the tank's biofilter colonies a lot easier in many cases.

Pet_Supplies,B000NVG6Y0,can the perch shed larger birds?,"Cardinals  manage to feed, and, with trial and error, doves occasionally manage to feed (safflower seeds, which squirrels supposedly don't like). Blue jays seem to have a tough go with it. Red wing blackbirds less so. All the same, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, etc., are what usually perch."

Pet_Supplies,B000P9TNLI,When placed in the car are there straps/loops to put seat belts through to buckle the crate in for road trips?,This is a travel crate in that it is light and folds down easily so that it can be transported for travel when compared to rigid metal or plastic crates.

Pet_Supplies,B000P9TNLI,How is it to put together?,"There is no assembly required.  The metal frame on the top has bars that fit into each other, secured by a sliding sleeve that secures the crate in the upright position. Much like a baby stroller, you can undo the sleeve and the Noz2Noz collapses and folds into itself when not in use.  The size when folded is the size of the floor, so it depends on what you order as to how big it is for storage.  The cover does not come off, but can be easily cleaned with a vacuum or washed with a hose and left to air dry.  Best soft crate on the market!"
Pet_Supplies,B000P9TNLI,How is it to put together?,"Sides pop up like an inverted card table.  Folded fabrics open and expand with frame.  You can feel the snap seat itself, that means it's secure. Adjust curtains/opening(s).  Start singing ""Who Let The Dogs Out""."

Pet_Supplies,B000SIJT42,Can you travel on the airlines with these?  Will they fit underneath the seat on an airplane?,"You can only travel with the small Sleepypod as it fits under an airline seat.  You cannot travel with a medium Sleepypod, as it does not fit under an airline seat.  Other option is to purchase the rectangle airline carrier Sleepypod.

Pet_Supplies,B000SIJT42,How does traveling work with the top open?  Do you need a harness to keep your pet in?,"If you travel with the top open the only thing that would hold your pet in is connecting his/her leash to a built-in plastic loop inside.

Pet_Supplies,B000TZ3SM8,can this be used for a fancy rat?,Too small. Some rats get pretty big
Pet_Supplies,B000TZ3SM8,can this be used for a fancy rat?,"Small for a rat. You would be better off getting a ferret cage, they get quite fat in their old age."

Pet_Supplies,B000VZXROU,Can the second and third levels be switched so second level opens on left and third on right?,"Yes, all three levels are fully assembled but in separate sections so when putting together you can put the top two in any order.

Pet_Supplies,B000WFORH0,"Why are there so many vegetables? Grains are bad, but veggies aren't far behind.","Vegetables are not bad at all. In the wild and on farms, cats frequently eat the stomach contents of their prey, giving them a small portion of predigested plants and fiber. Grains are also not bad, per se, it just shouldn't make up more than a small fraction of their food."

Pet_Supplies,B001F97JAO,Would this fit a 20 gallon long,"No, it's for a 20 tall only."
Pet_Supplies,B001F97JAO,Is it safe to put a UVB light device and a heating light as well on this cover - how heat safe is it?,"The screen and its frame are made of metal.  The screening itself is rigid and fairly sturdy, not like window screening.  So long as the lighting fixture is not excessively heavy, putting a lighting fixture on top of the screen should be fine.  Make sure you allow adequate space for air to circulate and heat to escape, and make sure you allow the lizards within to have a heat gradient so they can choose whether they want a cooler portion of the tank or a warmer portion to thermoregulate."

Pet_Supplies,B003BYQ1L4,How is this item for cats that do not have front claws?,"Probably fine. Clawless cats can still use the posts to stretch. Each tier is easy to access by jumping with minimal effort for many cats, barring age or physical limitations. If your cats are adventurous or daring and try to jump up two tiers instead of stair-stepping, they may get frustrated with their inability to claw their way to the top, but that would be the least of their upsets."
Pet_Supplies,B003BYQ1L4,How is this item for cats that do not have front claws?,"Even if they don't have front claws they should still be able to jump up on the different levels.  They won't have any need for the scratching posts but should still love jumping,climbing and sitting on it."

Pet_Supplies,B003I5VNEG,Is this big enough for a teddy bear hamster?,"No, it isn't. The cage doesn't have enough floor space to fit the size wheel that a teddy bear hamster needs (they need 11"" wheels). The kind that comes with this cage is for dwarf hamsters or gerbils. Teddy bear hammies also will get stuck in the tubes. If you have a teddy bear you will want something like a wire cage without tubes (or those that can use the ferret type of tubing)."

Pet_Supplies,B003IWYPXK,can this ramp be used on the back seat car door?  or just the back,"sorry for delay, been away. no,i dont think you could steady it enough to work. if you have a large dog you really need to be able to secure it good and not have a steep angle.i have dodge nitro & dodge ram and i couldn't get it to work good. the dogs are a lab & pointer."

Pet_Supplies,B003IWYPXK,Can this be used on a bed?,"Not sure it would work so well for a bed. The top, where it meets the car meshes with the bottom of the car. It would not mesh as well with the bed. Depends on how agile your dog is. Also the top has a place to secure it to the car so that it won't move around while the dog is on it. There is no place to secure it on the side of a bed."
Pet_Supplies,B003OYIB64,does this carrier have a rigid floor,"The floor is semi-rigid. If it were more rigid than it is, it'd be uncomfortable for the dog."

Pet_Supplies,B003OYOPNW,Will this work in a two gallon tall aquarium?,"As the unit comes it requires a minimum depth of 11 inches.  In wider aquariums people have been known to lean the unit to one side to achieve depth. If the tank is deep enough the unit will work as described in the various reviews.  If your tank isn't that deep and you still want one of these, the tubing can be cut to allow for use in lower depth aquariums, but it would probably void any warranties once you modified the unit."
Pet_Supplies,B003OYOPNW,Will this work in a two gallon tall aquarium?,"Yes.  In shallower water you have to prime it first.  Just tip to the water line (on the vacuum) it until in starts, then you can use it at any angle."

Pet_Supplies,B003OYOPNW,could this be cut so that it will work in a tank that is 7 inches tall?,"Perhaps, but you would certainly not be able to attach gravel sifting attachment. With it on, the fabric bag and impeller would be above the waterline. That would prevent suction pump/impellor from priming and developing suction."

Pet_Supplies,B003TUNVXG,Is it sheep fur or cruelty free?,"If it contains wool, then it is not sheep friendly. Unfortunately, sheep workers are paid by the pound of wool they shear not by the hour or quality. This causes many of the sheep to be cut in the process and some of them even bleed out and die. Please research the types of materials that are animal free or cruelty free and check the product you are buying for these materials to be sure.

The more 'gunk' you allow to get trapped inside the UV tank, the less effective the UV bulb will be. As others have also pointed out, you also want to keep the good bacteria in your filter element. Despite the filters and/or UV treatment, it is the good bacteria that is doing the majority of the work in keeping your water balanced and (hopefully) clear."

Pet_Supplies,B0000C11OW,Is this the best Meltonian product for conditioning and preserving the quality of leather shoes? Or is something like saddle soap or mink oil better?,"This is a fairly easy product to use on leather goods already in decent shape. It is easier to use than saddle soap. However it will not repair or improve leather already damaged, cracked or heavily worn. Saddle soap will work better on more worn leather though it has its limits also. If your shoes are in good shape, the Meltonian will work well to clean and condition them and your hands won't stain from using it. Hope this helps you."

Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,What is flap size?,The size of the flap
Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,"Is the liner removable so that this can be put on a thin, panel door?","No, it is not.  The spacer is molded into one of the exterior sections.  It could be cut down but the alternate side contains the hinge, latches and sweeper that would protrude through the door.  The best solution is a plywood shim plate on each side that fits the cat door to a thinner door."
Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,Do the cats' tails get caught or hurt from the flap closing?,The flap doesn't slam down that fast & the animals' tails are able to hold the flap up and do not get caught.  Never had a problem yet (have had these doors and 3 cats plus 1 dog have used them).

The green one lockes the door so the cat can't get out. The other locks the door so the cat  can't get in.if you push both switches to the middle, the cats can come and go. If you push the switches towards the outside,  then the previous applies."
Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,Is it a one-way or two-way door?,"It's 4 way: open both ways, closed both ways, only in, only out"
Pet_Supplies,B0002DHMC4,Will it work in a pocket door? how thick is the frame?,"It might, it sticks out from the door 1/4"" on each side of the door so depending on the room you have in your pocket, it may work."

Pet_Supplies,B0002DI4I0,DOES THE VENT ON TOP CLOSE TO KEEP OUT RAIN?,Yes the vent does close with a simple rotation and is a very small vent anyway. If you are worried about rain coming in be more concerned about having a door on the house because water will splash up from the ground and go inside that way.
Pet_Supplies,B0002DI4I0,How do you get your dog to go in it?,"1.)  If you got the ""add-on"" door flap, don't install it until your pet gets used to going in and out of the house.  2.)  ALWAYS put your pet's food IN the house - and leave it there.  It's sort of like kids, if your pet is hungry, they'll eat.....even if it means going into this new, strange (to them) shelter!  Hang in there and good luck!! : )"

Pet_Supplies,B0002DJL0K,Would this work for rats?,This is designed for ferrets only
Pet_Supplies,B0002DJL0K,When you pull it does it stay streched out or does it slink back?,"It slinks back sadly, you can get black drainage tubing from a hard ware store 4"" some places have clear. It's a lot cheaper, last longer and you can move it the way you want to! =]"

Pet_Supplies,B0002DJL0K,"Would you be able to connect this to a dryer duct connector? (Not for dryer use, for a homemade ferret cage)","it is around the same size, the only difference is the dryer hose is NOT clear, they come in white or silver. you can hook it to a dryer. same material and same metal inside, the ferrets ripped through it in hours of having it, so not worth the money, cheaper to get dryer hose and use that."

Pet_Supplies,B0002DK26C,How big is the treat opening?,It's about 1 inch across and it funnels half way into the ball so the treats don't just drop out easily. The dog has to roll it around and the treats come out intermittently.
Pet_Supplies,B0002DK26C,What kind of treats do you use for a treat ball?,"Small ""training treat"" type ones...  like Charlie Bear or something similar."
Pet_Supplies,B0002DK26C,What kind of treats do you use for a treat ball?,Mostly regular dry food.

Pet_Supplies,B0002H3S5K,does each container hold 40lb? or 20lbs each?,"The two together in the picture is only to show that they are stackable. They are sold one each and each one holds roughly 40lbs of average size and weight of dog food. If used to store rice or grain, then it would hold a different amount. A more accurate way is to take the dimensions and determine if the volume fits your needs."

Pet_Supplies,B0002H3S5K,does each container hold 40lb? or 20lbs each?,These containers each hold 40 lbs.
Pet_Supplies,B0002H3S5K,"Is this container rodent-proof? Meaning, is there any way rodents could chew through this plastic?","Judging by the shape of the corners, and the thickness and hardness of the plastic, i think that it would be very difficult for a rodent to chew that container. Perhaps a large rodent with unlimited access and no distractions might eventually damage it, but since the container is air-tight and no food odor would be present, the rodent wouldn't have reason to suspect it contained food. While nothing is 100%, i'd say that this family of containers stands a better chance than anything else i have ever used of being considered ""rodent-proof""."
Pet_Supplies,B0002H3S5K,Will one of these fit a 25 pound bag of flour? Also can one of these hold a 20 pound bag of rice?,Oh yes. Both.

Pet_Supplies,B0002IJQDC,How do you clean it up?,"There's nothing to clean up. It's a wax that is absorbed into your dog's paws to heal the dry, cracked pads and to make them pliable. Don't put a thick glob of it on. Just rub enough onto the paws and in between the pads to give them a nice, thin, even coat. Rub it in just like you would if you were putting lotion on your own hands."
Pet_Supplies,B0002IJQDC,How do you clean it up?,It doesn't stay on long enough to do so as they lick it off!
Pet_Supplies,B0002IJQDC,Do you place paw on the wax and rub it around?,"You rub  it into the bottom pads on the dogs feet.

Pet_Supplies,B0002XUHYY,"Does the colored part of the plastic glow, or does it just look like a white light from a distance?","There is a small white ""window"" on the front of the plastic piece that provides clear non- colored light."
Pet_Supplies,B0002XUHYY,How do you change the battery?,"Turn the light so the black on/off button is on top. On that same side of the bulb/battery case, you'll see a series of little ridges, then the lip of the black back of the case. With one thumb, press down on the little ridges; with the other thumb, push against the lip of the case back until the back comes off. If you're having trouble, put more pressure on the little ridges.Change the batteries. When you're putting the case back together, put the other edges of the case together, then press down on the little ridges while you bring the back to snap back together."
Pet_Supplies,B0002XUHYY,How do you change the battery?,"It uses 3 AAA batteries. You squeeze under the switch and the compartment opens.  Pop in the batteries, close it up and it's ready to go."

Pet_Supplies,B00074W3RW,what would be a good slip lead leash size for a french bulldog?,Any slip lead will do the same job but the rope type may be overkill for a French Bulldog.  Just depends on what you are using it for.  For everyday walks the rope type will work but if you are showing your dog at a dog show you will need a more thinner slip lead.  It basically is up to you and what you like. - there are several types and thicknesses available.

The handle to then end, or the distance between the ""collar"" and ""handle""?",They are measuring from the tip of the handle to the end of the rope where it meets itself to make the collar.

Pet_Supplies,B000793L14,Can it be use on a garage door,This one works really well on solid and internal hollow doors as it contains a strip that is inserted between the 2 sides of the cat flap to cover the area where the door has been cut.

Pet_Supplies,B000ELUQQS,Do you have to use crystals for this littler box to work or can you use regular clumping litter?,"Emilie: You need the crystals for a couple of reasons. First, clumping litter will not sift thru the metal rakes of the self-cleaning litter box, thus rendering the self-cleaning aspect virtually non-existent. Second, clumping litter doesn't eliminate the odor of urine or feces on contact like the crystals do, another important feature of the self-cleaning litter box since the cleaning mechanism doesn't trigger until after 20 mins. to assure the cat is out of the box before it starts."

Eventually the urine will permeate the paper tray.In this case:  Use as directed is a good path to follow."

Pet_Supplies,B008J13W4S,Is it just the stand or do the bowls come with it?  What is the diameter of the 2qt bowls?,"The bowls come with it and are about 8.5"" each (entire width is 17.5"" so can't be far from that). As for the noise because they are metal, that is easily solved by taking a thin strip of weather stripping and sticking to the underside of the rim of the bowl. Or take some pieces of black felt and stick them to the 4 contact points. Great design and sturdy"
Pet_Supplies,B008J13W4S,Is the stand wood or metal?,Metal and it is poorly made
Pet_Supplies,B008M40ROU,what gauge is the wire?,18 gauge. It's not really the thickness of the wire but it is the outside coating that makes this the wire to use. Any thicker wire and it is harder to install...just a thought

Pet_Supplies,B008M7353W,is this large enough for a German Shepard?,"The Medium sized Grinz ball is the size of a tennis ball.

Pet_Supplies,B008M7353W,does it use any type or size treats,"Yes 1/2 "" diameter, but keeping it clean inside is too much work"
Pet_Supplies,B008M7353W,Does the ball squeak at all?,No it does not squeak.  If your dog is a heavy duty chewer - and can destroy toys - they will be able to destroy this one.
Pet_Supplies,B008M7353W,Does the ball squeak at all?,"No, they don't squeak."
Pet_Supplies,B008M7353W,Does the ball squeak at all?,"They're made of a hard plastic, your dog will not be able to chew on it. They have a hard time getting the treat out as it is...they're pretty sturdy, will last for yrs."
Pet_Supplies,B008M7353W,what are the dimensions?,"Haven't measured them, but they are slightly smaller than a standard tennis ball"

Pet_Supplies,B008MG5GRQ,is the collar tag small enough for a cat? (11 pound cat),"no, if the cat is outside it might get caught on something and the cat would be stuck there."
Pet_Supplies,B008MG5GRQ,"Does the display indicate both bearing and range when in tracking mode? And if range is indicated, is it displayed as a distance or signal strength?","The range will show up as a signal strength  and percentage strength. The signal strength is similar to a cell phone. It will also indicate in terms of a percentage how close you are to the pet.  The higher the percentage, the closer to the pet you are.  The higher the signal strength the closer you are to the pet.  If you look at their website, they have a FAQ's page that compares the Marco Polo to the competition.  They also have lots of great info on the FAQ Page. Their website: eurekaproducts.com. Hope this helps"
Pet_Supplies,B008MG5GRQ,Why is there such wide discrepancy btwn range distances among customers? One said it's up to 3 miles while another says the dog had to be very close.,"The range will depend on terrain and buildings etc between you and the dog.  A little practice with it is valuable so you learn the equipment. In open flat terrain with few trees and buildings, you'd probably get over two miles. But in rugged wooded hilly terrain you'd get less."
Pet_Supplies,B008N9LJ5K,Is the screen top metal?,The black borders are plastic.  The screen is a normal metal screen.
Pet_Supplies,B008N9LJ5K,Is this ok for an adult ball python? Thank u,It's not very tall.   Great for a bearded dragon.   Will work for a python but not the best display.

Pet_Supplies,B008QVKBLS,Would this illuminate a 35 hexagonal tank effectively?,No not bright enough for a tank that large.
Pet_Supplies,B008QVKBLS,Would this illuminate a 35 hexagonal tank effectively?,That will probably be most dependant on what you have in the tank. The LEDs are pretty bright and can most certainly light up a tank of the right dimensions.
Pet_Supplies,B008QVKBLS,"If using on a timer, will the selected light mode remain set when the timer cycles the power on and off?","No unfortunately it won't. It has a touch switch that cycles through 3 selections. Blue, blue-white, white and off."

Pet_Supplies,B008QVKBLS,Would this be enough light for low-medium light plants in a 10 gal aquarium?,"Nope, it's unreliable also."
Pet_Supplies,B008VRXEK2,Hi is this stand ok to use with a 30 on top and 30 on bottom?,"No , it's only 26 5/8 inches wide on the inner diameter !! You would wave to put a smaller tank on the bottom !!"

Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,"is this heater suitable for a 1/2 gallon tank? if not, can you recommend any that are?","No, it will boil any fish in it. Grab a slightly bigger tank (no fish can go in a 1/2 gallon healthily) and no heater will work well for such a small size :("
Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,what are the dimensions of this heater?,Product Dimensions: 4 x 1 x 1 inches
Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,what are the dimensions of this heater?,It's approx 4 1/2 inches long

Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,Have 1 gal round glass bowl.  Will it work & will suction cup stick to side of round bowl?,"This heater is on continuously - it doesn't cycle on and off to maintain steady water temperature and not overheat. Could be dangerous in such a small bowl. Oh, yeah, speaking of small bowls, 1 gallon is WAY too small for any kind of fish (maybe ok for sea monkeys)!"
Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,Have 1 gal round glass bowl.  Will it work & will suction cup stick to side of round bowl?,It will work not sure on suction cup
Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,Is this safe for a 1/2 gallon plastic tank?,"It is completely safe in the sense that it cannot get hot enough to damage or melt plastic.  It may still make the water too warm however, it all depends on the ambient (room) temperature.  This has no thermostat, it simply emits 5 watts worth of heat all the time.  You would need to try it with a thermometer, and be aware if the room gets warmer so will the water.  All the parameters in only a half gallon of water will fluctuate rapidly and are difficult to control- if this is for livestock and you can get something larger you will find it much easier and much better for the inhabitants."
Pet_Supplies,B0090I7RC2,How long is the power cord on this?,The power cord is about 6' long.
Pet_Supplies,B0097C9S9Q,does it come with it's power suply ?,"Yes, the power supply is included."

Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,Is the lid cat-proof?,Not for a clever and determined cat.  It simply rests on the top of the aquarium with small plastic feet to keep it from sliding off.

Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,Is this tank made of glass?? Not acrylic?,"It is made of glass but the base has a plastic black frame. It's a beautiful modern looking tank but when filled with water feels about 20 pounds or more. When lifting it, the plastic base can feel a bit flimsy.  When empty, you wouldn't be able to tell."
Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,Is this tank made of glass?? Not acrylic?,Yes the tank is made of glass.  The base of the tank and the lid are made of plastic though.
Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,Is this tank made of glass?? Not acrylic?,"Yes the tank is made of glass. The pump and filter area is the same pane of glass but has a frosted finish. The glass has a good thickness too. The partition between the pump and filter is black plastic --as is the base riser, but the actual bottom of the tank is clear glass also. The top cover is clear plastic. The corners joining the panes are made of aluminium."

Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,Is the pump pressure adjustable?,Yes it is an adjustable pump and it is so quiet you don't even know it's on
Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,can you use this tank for goldfish?,"This tank is not well suited for goldfish.  While young goldfish are small and you might think they can live in a tank of this size, however this really isn't a good idea.  Goldfish are pretty dirty fish, meaning they produce more potent waste than other fish.  So despite the fact that they will easily out grow this aquarium, as it is a larger tank is required to deal with their waste."
Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,can you use this tank for goldfish?,"No, you absolutely cannot. Goldfish need a much, MUCH larger tank than this. The reason people think goldfish have such a short lifespan is because they're usually kept in aquariums that are too small or even in unfiltered bowls. Only somebody who truly does not care about animals would put a goldfish in one of these - let alone 3 like somebody else suggested."
Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,can you use this tank for goldfish?,sure. It would be better than just a goldfish bowl because of the filtration system. Goldfish are a bit dirtier than bettas or other fish. wouldn't have to clean the tank so often.
Pet_Supplies,B009K0ZKAQ,can you use this tank for goldfish?,"A goldfish should be fine, as long as it's not a real big goldfish....it's a really nice little tank."

Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,Does this come with the 2 different length ropes for training like in the infomercial? Thanks,"if you order the complete set up from don sullivan you will get the 2 different lengths.  if you order the collar from amazon, you will also have to order the training ropes separately. though easy enuff to make your own training leads with plain ole laundry rope."
Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,Does this come with the 2 different length ropes for training like in the infomercial? Thanks,There are no ropes included.  They are purchased separately.
Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,Must the dog wear this all of the time?  How can they chew thru this collar?,Um is this actually a question? The dog wears this like a regular choke collar and there are three string leashes you can use in and out of the house (as needed). As far as chewing through it is more likely the dog would chew the string like leash. The collar is adjustable and there is really no way the dog can chew the collar unless it is very lose and not adjusted properly.
Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,Must the dog wear this all of the time?  How can they chew thru this collar?,No. The dog only wears this during training sesions.
Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,How is this different than a prong collar?,More suttle and gets the job done when used correctly
Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,How is this different than a prong collar?,"Its not really, i dont use it anymore for that reason. Its all made out of hard plastic with no metal prongs just plastic prongs"

Pet_Supplies,B00AP5RZKS,"Can you use this collar as a replacement, or do you only use it during training?","No, it is a trainiing collar only!  It is made of hard plastic pieces hooked together and would be dangerous to leave on.  It is a great trainiing collar, especially to stop dogs from pulling on leash because it tightens when the dog pulls--which is another reason it would be dangerous to leave on!!"
Pet_Supplies,B00B2OLHJG,how many feet does it reach to?,"Not many, it hasn't stopped the dogs from barking"

Pet_Supplies,B00B2STMKS,you can put this right on your dogs collar?? You don't need a special harness correct?,You might as well not use one of these if you are going to attach it to a collar. Instead of going thru the windshield you dogs neck will snap in an accident.
Pet_Supplies,B00B2STMKS,you can put this right on your dogs collar?? You don't need a special harness correct?,You will. Break your dog's neck if you use just the collar. A harness is the safe and recommended way to use this. Check with your vet or read the cautions.

Pet_Supplies,B00B2STMKS,how does this attach to the seat belt,The rectangle part just slips into the seat belt console like a normal shoulder strap would.  Tried it in several different cars.  Adjust the strap so the dog can't get thrown to the floor.  :D

Pet_Supplies,B00B2STMKS,can it hold a 70lb dog,"It would probably hold, but may not be long enough for your dog to stand or sit depending upon his height or body length."

Pet_Supplies,B00BD3UN8C,does it have plastic parts,The only plastic on the entire unit is the water pump assembly with what looks like a plastic rough filter that fits around it likely to catch cat hair from going into the pump and is located under the tower inside the bowl.  The bowl and tower are ceramic.  There is a charcoal replaceable filter as well.
Pet_Supplies,B00BD3UN8C,does it have plastic parts,The pump and the housing that holds the disposable charcoal filter are plastic. The fountain itself is all ceramic. No problems with it as far as cleaning or replacing the filter so far.

The goo described below seems to make the pump run slowly even when the filters are changed frequently.,Nobody mentions using an old tooth-brush or cotton swabs to clean inside the motor (removing the impeller) but this makes it dead easy.

Pet_Supplies,B00H8MDLUE,Is it really practically dust free?,"Yes, really very little dust. But as others have mentioned, the chemical fragrance is unpleasant, and it doesn't seem to clump any better than the regular stuff."
Pet_Supplies,B00HK04D1A,Do these bags have handles?,"No, the bag does not have handles.  Just a square bag.  It is on the larger side though."

So yes but just needs a little dismantling
Pet_Supplies,B00HUE9LCM,Does this one fold in sections so a person can sit in backseat also?,Yes you could do that. It folds in 3 sections so you could fold over the left or right side for a passenger & still have the remaindin 2/3 supported for the dog.

Pet_Supplies,B00006H36Z,First time applying and most went on fur (she wouldn't sit still)...will it still work?,The way it works is that it is absorbed into the skin and into the bloodstream. Then when the flea bites the animal it ingests the meddecib which makes it sterile and kills it. It isn't like a repellent that scares them away - so yes it needs to be mostly on the skin so it can be absorbed. Try two people- one to hold the animal and one to apply. Base of head where it meets neck is good because hard to reach by cat. Hope that helps! Good luck!
Pet_Supplies,B00006H36Z,does it work on ticks?,Yes it does!! It is a wonderful treatment for fleas and ticks. Well worth the money :):)

Location can alter the signal in the field wire so test the collar before putting on a pet for use.
Pet_Supplies,B0001ZWZ98,Are you able to move the unit easily if wanted so you could have wire at home and somewhere else ie. the lake and just move the transmitter?,Yes. Once you have everything up at one location you could disconnect the fence wire and unplug the main unit. Take it to the second location with more fence wire and set it up there. Once both locations are set up all you would need to do is disconnect the 2 fence wires and unplug the unit. Just be sure you have enough fence wire to leave in place a both locations.
Pet_Supplies,B0001ZWZ98,Are you able to move the unit easily if wanted so you could have wire at home and somewhere else ie. the lake and just move the transmitter?,"Yes.

This is a larger door which also folds out from the cage to let the bird sit on it as well.
Pet_Supplies,B00024Y5Q4,Where is the door on this cage?  It is a slide up and down style door or another kind?,The door is the actual door on the cottage. It slides up then opens out.
Pet_Supplies,B00024Y5Q4,Does this cage work for a cockatiel?,"Hi Loretta, In answer to your question, the Featherstone Heights Cottage Birdcage would be too small for your cockatiel, However, the Featherstone Heights Victorian Birdcage #294 would be more suitable for the cockatiel /parakeet size bird.  This birdcage measures 18"" L by 18"" W and 25"" High. All the Featherstone Heights Birdcages are made in the USA and are well made with 5/8"" wire space.  Hope this will help in your decision.  Have a good day.    Sincerely, Don and Pat Daugherty"

Pet_Supplies,B000255NXC,Will this system work for a fish tank with sand? Description states it cleans gravel.,"FYI there is a video posted on YOUTUBE which shows that it can be done without sucking up the sand, since the unwanted matter is sitting on top of the sand it shows that the tube should be at least one inch above the sand to prevent sand from entering the tube and hose. Please check it out."
Pet_Supplies,B000255NXC,Will this system work for a fish tank with sand? Description states it cleans gravel.,Here is a video of someone using this in what looks like a tank with sand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf2L8F7Vtyk
Pet_Supplies,B000255NXC,Will this system work for a fish tank with sand? Description states it cleans gravel.,"No. It works wonderfully w/gravel but is much too powerful for sand, you'll end up w/most of it in your sink. For sand bottoms you really need an ""under sand/gravel filter"". Good luck :-)"
Pet_Supplies,B000255NXC,Will this system work for a fish tank with sand? Description states it cleans gravel.,"No, it will suck up the sand."
Pet_Supplies,B000255NXC,Will this work if the tank is lower than the sink drain and faucet?  Can't siphon with gravity because of that.,It will certainly work to fill it but for the syphon to flow in emptying it won't. You might be able to get away with leaving your faucet running - that is what starts the syphon for you ... but you will waste a lot of water if it does.
Pet_Supplies,B000255NXC,Will this work if the tank is lower than the sink drain and faucet?  Can't siphon with gravity because of that.,"Yes, as long as you have the water running fast enough it will pull water from 5' feet below."

Pet_Supplies,B000256962,Can this product be used on any plant to boost photosynthesis?,This product is only for carbon use.If you are not running any co2 system.This product is a repalcement.To help with photosynthesis you would need some sort of good lighting and plant food.Like API leaf zone or seachem flourish.Seachem excel is a source of bio-available organic carbon.
Pet_Supplies,B000256962,Can this product be used on any plant to boost photosynthesis?,Photosynthesis takes place in the presence of light only. And when it starts photosynthesis requires co2 to keep the process going.C02 is a must for occurring photosynthesis but c02 does not lead to photosynthesis. So if your aquarium light is on from that time photosynthesis starts and you need to add c02(if enough co2 is not produced by the fishes) to keep photosynthesis running.
Pet_Supplies,B000256962,"What's the difference between the Seachem Flourish Excel and the Seachem Flourish ""non excel""?","Flourish contains essential trace elements and micronutrients. Basically fertilizer. Flourish Excel provides a source of carbon, without using complicated and expensive carbon dioxide systems. Both work very well together."

Pet_Supplies,B00176GMDU,Will this fit a 10 gallon tank?,Fit yes but if have this filter in a 100 gallon tank with 2 turtles and it keeps the water crystal clear so u could get a much smaller one for a 10 gallon tabk

Pet_Supplies,B001B4TV2W,Do u think this would work well as a tennis ball for playing actual tennis?,"Not a player, but the medium seems smaller, the large is definitely bigger and they're more like a racquetball. It's got good bounce on hard surfaces but quickly deminishes the softer it is. real noticeable from hard packed red clay and the same with 1/8 inch sand on top. because of the two holes it will not bounce straight up and down, sometimes with great shift."
Pet_Supplies,B001B4TV2W,Do u think this would work well as a tennis ball for playing actual tennis?,"Um, no. Not a 'serious' game if you want points to count or anything because it's going to bounce odd if it lands on one of the hole openings. And it's a little heavier than a tennis ball. But if you just want a knock-around just-for-fun game at night  with the court lights off, give it a try, and tell us about it  ;)"
Pet_Supplies,B001B4TV2W,Do u think this would work well as a tennis ball for playing actual tennis?,"No.  Manufacturers of REAL tennis balls (not 'dog' tennis balls, but REAL tennis balls designed for playing tennis) must conform to very strict manufacturing procedures so that their balls can be trusted to bounce reliably and predictably in a tennis game.  Tennis balls are strictly regulated.  Imagine playing tennis with a ball that can't be trusted to bounce predictably!  You might have noticed that dog 'tennis' balls don't bounce very well--they aren't really tennis balls."
Pet_Supplies,B001B4TV2W,"How long does this stay glowing after you ""charge"" it?","After being in sunlight for a long time, it will glow for 30 minutes or so. But can hold it up to light for 30 seconds and it will glow long enough for a fetch or two..."

Pet_Supplies,B001B4TV2W,Can i play tennis with this ball?,"If you do, use an old racket that you don't care much about, do it at night with the court lights off, don't keep score, and tell us about it! ~Never pass up an opportunity to have fun -and laugh. This should make someone LOL"

Pet_Supplies,B001UIGQ22,"how long before going out on walk should it be applied?  And do you need to apply it each walk, every day??",It's more about conditioning your dog's pads as often as you can so they will repel the painful salt and chemicals on surfaces. Apply as often as he or she will allow! It's the best stuff available!

Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Can this cage be used for an iguana?,"An Iguana's claws and weight would just tear this cage apart. It is made with the same screen as a screen door so its not meant to have larger reptiles climbing it. This cage is great for chameleons and nothing larger than that. For an Iguana cage you will want to invest in a custom built one with heavy duty mesh, or buy a much more sturdy cage online that is meant for iguanas specifically."
Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Can this cage be used for an iguana?,Maybe a baby iguana but it is not big or strong enough for an adult iguana. It's claws would destroy this cage easily.

Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,could i put  a corns snake in it?,Should be ok as long as it's not laying directly on the screen material.  It's a little rough for reptile skin.
Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Would Crickets or other insects be able to get out of this enclosure?,"It is a pretty solid cage and as long as is closed you are safe, but if you are using any backdrop crickets do hide behind it and die, making the whole thing a mess to clean."

Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Is this a good cage for an adult sized bearded dragon? He is currently in a 40 gal tank,"No only if you turn it down to a horizontal position to tall. Dragons need lite close and they don't climb , this cage is more so for iguannas un less you turn it down"
Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,is this strong enough for a large snake?,"Depends on the snake. Id say a snake that gets about 4-6 ft. in length and also lives mostly in trees (or climbing environment) would be a good fit, personally id go with a glass/acrylic tank for a snake environment if it isnt a species known to climb. This cage will also make it more difficult to keep high humidity due to the air flow. You will also most likely have to weigh down the bottom to avoid it tipping over with a large snake. You're better off getting a large tank instead."
Pet_Supplies,B001V3WXM8,Is the screen nylon or metal?,The screen is aluminum unlike the other screen cages on the market which are actually Teflon-coated steel that rusts (test them with a magnet). It is the same quality/thickness as window screening.

Pet_Supplies,B00239W4Q4,"Hi, can the bracket fix on any handlebar or is there a recommended diameter of the handlebar?","It will fit on most standard handlebars which are about 1"" in diameter.  Newer more expensive mountain bikes are using a 31mm bar which will not work. If you are using a mountain bike you might want to measure but otherwise you shoul be fine. God Bless"
Pet_Supplies,B0026MVCVQ,How does it attach to the window and wall ?,"If you have window that opens up from the bottom, there are mental L's  you have to attach to the shelf and slip over the sill.  If you window opens out you have to secure the shelf with screws."
Pet_Supplies,B0026MVCVQ,How does it attach to the window and wall ?,The shelf hooks onto the window frame.  The supports underneath have rubber feet in contact with the wall.  There are no fasteners required.
Pet_Supplies,B0026MVCVQ,Could you attach this to a flat wall? (no window),"There are little metal brackets on that side, so i suppose to could fashion a way to attach it to the wall.  wouldn't recommend it - get some cheap floating shelves from IKEA and add covering will accomplish the same thing and be alot more sturdy."
Pet_Supplies,B0026MVCVQ,Could you attach this to a flat wall? (no window),It could be done if you put up thick enough board for the back edge to screw on to.
Pet_Supplies,B0026MVCVQ,Could you attach this to a flat wall? (no window),"You would need a stud finder, mounting brackets, a level."
Pet_Supplies,B0026MVCVQ,will it still work with the window open,"If you have double-hung windows, the kind that slides up and down, it will work with the window open or closed. If you have sideways sliding windows or those with a crank that open to the outside it will only work when the window is open but not when it is closed as the track is not wide enough to accommodate the hooks and the window itself. In that case you are better off just to put a small table or anything else that is flat on top like a dresser in front of the window for the cat to sit or sleep on. You might also want to pad the feet some more as they tend to scratch the wall."
Pet_Supplies,B0027JAXNQ,Does this have a standard 3 wire grounded plug?,"No, it's only a two prong plug."
Pet_Supplies,B0027JAXNQ,Does this have a standard 3 wire grounded plug?,No . Just two. No ground.

Pet_Supplies,B005VQH3FI,Is the top removable to put and change lighting?  Or how hard is it?

If you do purchase it go to the company web page for step by step directions on putting it together as it only comes with a diagram."

Pet_Supplies,B005ZQA9TG,How many pieces to this set.  Will it fit lazy Boy recliner,"This is a single cover with long flaps for the arms, approximately cross-shaped.

Pet_Supplies,B0064JHVGC,What kind of flow should be put through the uv for a 125 tank? ei want pump size would work best for it?,"The answer depends entirely upon what you're using the UV sterilizer for.  If you're trying to kill parasites during their free-swimming life stage, then you need a slower pump so that the water (and the organisms floating in it) take longer to get through the sterilizer and so are exposed to more radiation.  If you're just trying to kill algae, then you want a higher-speed pump.  There's a chart included with the pump that indicates the flow-rate needed to kill different floating organisms.  What are you using the sterilizer for?"

Pet_Supplies,B001F2117I,What is the smallest amount of food you can dispense? What is the area of the opening on its smallest setting?,The gate opening is variable. One could open just a tiny slit. This feeder works well for pellets which have uniform sizes. The feeder is not suitable for flakes which obviously has variable sizes and causes inconsistent amount dispensed.
Pet_Supplies,B001F2117I,What is the smallest amount of food you can dispense? What is the area of the opening on its smallest setting?,You can dispense the tiniest amount.  It can be a few flakes at the smallest setting.  The smallest opening is about 1/8 of an inch.

Hole has to be larger than the flakes.  Rotation speed constant.  If you break up the flakes you can close the hole
Pet_Supplies,B001F2117I,do the size of the tank matters?,"Hey Darnell, no it doesn't, what matters is to hang it on the top edge and leave a space for the chamber to freely rotate and drop its fillings.Calibrate the door lid openning in advance to know exactly the amount of food it drops before hanging it. Make sure food particles are of same size, so don't mix big and small flakes"

Pet_Supplies,B003WNCSQ6,is this a wire free fence,"No.  This not a ""wireless"" dog containment system.  Meaning it does not work off a ""radio"" signal.  This package requires an in ground wire.  It simply does not come with the needed wire, that is why it is advertised as ""wireless.""  Very deceiving."
Pet_Supplies,B003WNCSQ6,is this a wire free fence,"It is not wire-free. You attach wire to the base unit and run the wire underground. When you turn on the base unit, the dog will get a warning noise and ultimately a shock (as slight or as hard as you choose) if it tries to go beyond where you've placed the wire. Flags above ground mark the wire's path.  The dog becomes conditioned to not going beyond the where the flags are and/or to the noise warning. It only takes once or twice being shocked before they learn not to wander beyond the border of the underground wire."
Pet_Supplies,B003WNCSQ6,How far does this fence reach without the wire?,The wire is the fence.  You should take a few minutes to read up on how the dog fences work - it should help you understand the way the system works and answer any future questions.

Pet_Supplies,B003WNCSQ6,How far does this fence reach without the wire?,"It needs the burried wire, this just doesn't have it.  The unit would hook up to wire if you already had wire installed.  It won't work at all if you don't have the wire."

Pet_Supplies,B007Z59K6I,How long do you have the dog do 4 MPH,"Why are you having the dog do 4 mph? With anything, you have to build up to endurance. If the dog isn't active, you don't want to start them running at high speed. The best use of the treadmill is to work on the dogs mental state. Start fast, then start slowing down the speed. When you have the dog being able to walk at 1 - 1.5mph without being distracted, you have hit the mental part, and are teaching the dog to learn to be calm. Which is what you want...a nice calm, satisfied, dog."
Pet_Supplies,B007Z59K6I,How long do you have the dog do 4 MPH,It would depend on the fitness level and size of your dog. Dogs usually start on 1.5 to 2 mph and build up the speed and fitness over time.Thank you

Pet_Supplies,B007Z59K6I,does it have a flat setting or must it run at a incline?,Its not completely flat at lowest setting due to the nature of construction however it is low enough to start a dog on it comfortable.
Pet_Supplies,B007Z59K6I,does it have a flat setting or must it run at a incline?,The lowest level is set at an incline of 5degrees so it is not completely flat.

However it is quite easy using a razor to remove a small section of the lip.  Removing this does not effect the rigidity of the tank.  So with slight modification of the tank it will fit.

Pet_Supplies,B003C5TPF6,what size heater for a 30 gallon fish tank,"Do some research, but the recommendation fr a 50-75w is ridiculously low. The minimum in a 30g tank would be 100 watts if you're just looking at a few degrees above ambient temperature. If you want to maintain more than five degrees above, then you should go with a 150 watts. Although it is more expensive to do, some people with larger tanks start looking at two smaller heaters, so maybe a 100 on one side and a 50 on the other, or a pair of 100s, so that your tank holds a reasonable temp if one fails and the wider spread of heating can help things even out better."

Anyone know if there's a redundant high-level sensor?,There is no redundancy high level and it has only one optical sensor. The Smart ATO's sensor is called AFS (auto feedback security) technology.

Pet_Supplies,B0006JKO9W,"Stupid question, Is this unit good to produce water or human consumption? i assume so but since it is not explicitly stated????","Well honestly you shouldn't really drink RO water. Or at least if it's deionized. It will rob you body of dissolved solids (as water always wants to have some dissolved solids in it). If you intend to drink RO DI water you need to infuse minerals or electeolytes into it so it's safe. Normally for RO drinking water (like vitamin water) they do not de unitized it so it would be a two step system vs this 3 step. Look for a system with the micron filter, carbon filter, and membrane filter only! And use it with tea or coffee for a more flavorful bevrage"
Pet_Supplies,B0006JKO9W,"Stupid question, Is this unit good to produce water or human consumption? i assume so but since it is not explicitly stated????",The only way that R/O water will hurt anyone is if they are fasting and only drinking R/O water.

There is a ""lip"" for lack of better terms on the tip of the glue. DO NOT cut on or past that lip!!! It's there for you to ""snap"" the applicator tip onto the glue.

Pet_Supplies,B0009YJ4N6,How is an air pump used and is it necessary if you have a filter?,"It may not be, it depends on the bioload of the tank and the size/type of filter.  If good circulation and surface movement is being achieved by the filter, extra airstones or wands are usually not necessary.  Don't overstock the tank, and make sure your filter is adequate and you will likely not need extra airstones.   Research the species you are keeping, some such as danios are adapted to more water current, others such as Angelfish and Bettas prefer still water."

An air pump is not necessity but they don't hurt ."

Pet_Supplies,B0047ZZ85G,what are the alternatives to buying the manufacturer's filters?,"It's perfectly fine to operate with no filter.  You may need to clean the foam screen on the intake pump (which disassembles for cleaning) a little more often - and even that's negligible -  but using this product without a filter doesn't cause any problems.  In truth, the primary function of the filter is to make the water ""taste better"" to your pet, much as Brita brand filter pitchers do for us humans.  If you wanted to, you could even put a mesh bag with activated carbon filter media (available in aquarium supply) into the filter reservoir space, but there's really no need."

Pet_Supplies,B0047ZZ85G,"instructions say to remove the filter reservoir by pulling straight up.  but,  it is firmly locked in place.  how do you remove this piece?","The are hard to get off the first time.  There are little hooks that hold the top part in place.  Hold on to the bottom piece with your left and pull up hard with your right .. it take a bit of strength to do it. Don't be afraid you'll break it. When you go to put it back on, check to see the hooks are lined up with the holes in the bottom piece then sharply chop downward with the side of your hand on the side of the top piece and it will click into place."

Pet_Supplies,B0049RL3H4,Also what if you just stop using- do your plants just stop the crazy growth or do you get algae problems?,"Totally depends on the other conditions in your tank.  If you have lots of light, heat, and nutrients, and your plants stop growing as quickly after you remove CO2, you can allow for algae to take over.  However, if your tank is low in light, nutrients, and heat, it shouldn't be too big a deal.  If you want your plants to grow to their potential CO2 is a must.  It is not a limiting factor for algae, but it is for plants."
Pet_Supplies,B0049RL3H4,Can i use 12 gram co2 airsoft cartridges?,"No, this requires a threaded cartridge.  You can buy boxes of 16g threaded cartridges for bike tires relatively cheap (~$25/30)"

Pet_Supplies,B004BZKDZC,Where is the intake for the water? (Sorry for being a bother),Its no bother.  The intake is the unit.

Pet_Supplies,B004BZKDZC,Where is the intake for the water? (Sorry for being a bother),"The intake is at the bottom - a 1"" by 2"" area. In the main picture, it's on the lower right hand side (it's not easy to see)."

It also isn't really designed for 'media,' rather a series of nets/rakes that block the passage of leaves/etc. which you then pull out periodically."
Pet_Supplies,B004KZEN9K,Can you use a bottom drain with this?,Probably not.  A bottom drain is going to be used for particles that sink in the water and are eliminated in a particulate filter.   This filter works great for leaves and grass that float on the surface.
Pet_Supplies,B004KZEN9K,Can you use a bottom drain with this?,There is nothing predrilled for the bottom. It has a hole at the top on each side for the tubing to come out.  You would have to drill your own hole and make something water tight for your tubing.

There is a special sprinkler head that comes with the unit that you screw on to a regular water hose.  The unit comes with a drain hose that is connected on the bottom of the tub to direct the drainage out and to the side."
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,How does the water hook up to the tub?  or do you  have to have your own water source?  What are the demensions?,You have to have your own hose connected to a water source (standard exterior faucet).  Only a fan shaped sprinkler head is provided to attach to your hose.  Dimensions of the tub depends on the size of the unit you buy for the size of your dog. There is a drain hose supplied for the unit.
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,"can this unit with legs on, be set into a bath tub, as the tile walls etc would make for easy clean up... so the with of the legs would be very import",The legs would be too wide for a standard tub.  The width of the back legs is just shy of 28 inches and the front legs is 27 inches.
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Would this tub fit inside a regular bathtub?  Or could you put just the front legs in the bathtub and the back 2 on the floor??,Only the front legs would fit. Or 1 front and 1 back leg. Too wide to put the whole bath into the tub.
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Would this tub fit inside a regular bathtub?  Or could you put just the front legs in the bathtub and the back 2 on the floor??,No it can not fit in regular bathtub.
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Would this tub fit inside a regular bathtub?  Or could you put just the front legs in the bathtub and the back 2 on the floor??,"You could not fit the tub inside a standard bathtub, but you could probably fit the back legs, since that's where it drains from and it could drain right into the bathtub."

Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Can the tub be used without the legs attached?,It's not b recommended.
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Can the tub be used without the legs attached?,"No, it would be unstable"
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Can the tub be used without the legs attached?,Perhaps if there was a larger base to raise the drain off of the ground. Removing the legs defeats the purpose of buying the tub. Might as well just stake the dog in the yard and hose it down with a garden hose. Using it without the legs will force customers to bend over to bathe a dog. That's not very ideal for anyone with back problems.
Pet_Supplies,B005THTCYE,Can the tub be used without the legs attached?,"Technically it can be used without legs, but it is designed to be used with legs to protect your back and make it easier to bath the dog. The back of the tub is open for the dog to step into the bathtub. You can call us at 800-865-6734 Monday-Friday PST with any additional questions."

Pet_Supplies,B005WEDVIM,"Is the base made out of plastic, or something sturdy that won't crack like the SPEC V did. Thanks!","It is a plastic base.  Seems very sturdy and as it just sits there, it seems to do a great job holding the weight of a water filled tank."
Pet_Supplies,B005WEDVIM,"Is the base made out of plastic, or something sturdy that won't crack like the SPEC V did. Thanks!","yes it is plastic, but i have not had any problems. however i do not move the tank at all. i just empty and clean the water were the tank is . so i'm not sure, if you move the tank during cleaning maybe the bottom would crack but i guess you take your chances with any product failing , the tank to this point has worked flawless, and i would recomend it"
Pet_Supplies,B005WEDVIM,"Is the base made out of plastic, or something sturdy that won't crack like the SPEC V did. Thanks!","The base is a standard plastic hood (sides and spines in the base, but nothing more) that holds up as long as you don't try to laterally move anything, otherwise you risk pushing the plastic walls around and damaging them. This is especially problematic since the base has rubber feet that are inserted (not glued or secured) into peg holes in the base. The more you skooch the base in any direction the more you risk making one of the rubber feet pop out, which makes the plastic base scratch directly against whatever surface it sits on."

Pet_Supplies,B005WEDVIM,Does the water need to be filled completely to the top for everything to work properly??  Or can there be a few inches of space at the top left empty,It doesn't have to be filled to the top.  The filter intake is long enough to draw up water even if it's 2 or 3 inches below the top.
Pet_Supplies,B005WEDVIM,Does anyone know how big the opening at the top of the 6-gallon tank is? It looks very small. And has anyone had any problems getting décor and plants in and out of the tank?,"opening is 5"" X 7"".  Light is on an arm that swing up from this space.  It is harder than a regular aquarium to get things in and out of and do maintenance with.  Also, to get the best effect, the water should be filled to a level that brings it in contact with the top... so less surface area for gas exchange."
Pet_Supplies,B005WEDVIM,can the old halogen light system be replaced by the LED system?,There are replacements for both systems.Hagen Fluval Edge Replacement 12 Gallon 42-LED Lamp Fixture (Fluval A-13926)Hagen Fluval Edge Replacement 6 Gallon 21-LED Lamp Fixture (Fluval A-13924)an adapter is also required.

You will have to test them out to see which one your pup can identify with the most. This product will help with the initial phase of anxiety of being lost.
