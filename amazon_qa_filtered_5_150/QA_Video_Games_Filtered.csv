It'll just sound like sticks hitting a rubber surface. So technically you could, but it wouldn't be anywhere close to a real set.

Video_Games,B0047ERZ7Q,dose it work with the pspvita,doesn't vita have cameras though?

Video_Games,B0047ERZ7Q,Which one is better this camera or the one from the ps vita?,"This camera and the built-in cameras on the Vita are all 640x480. Looking at pictures from both, they're about the same in terms of overall image quality.  Not terribly good.  (That said, there is a higher-quality camera available for the PSP if you want to import - the 1.3 megapixel Chotto Shot which was never released in North America.)"
Video_Games,B0047ERZ7Q,Which one is better this camera or the one from the ps vita?,"sony psp takes a better picture,, it has a focus knob on it. and it can take macro pictures with zoom function"
Video_Games,B0047ERZ7Q,how many megapixels.. if any...??,megapixels are an over rated spec . Camera manual states 0.3 megapixels . The psp is a versatile media player and the camera is a nice upgrade .

Video_Games,B004MR3QY4,What is the difference with the black edition?,The original deathadder (blue glowing scroll wheel) but the black editions is just about the same thing (just with no glowing).The old versions use actual drivers. the new 2013 version requires the use of the synapse 2.0 program.You need to create an account and it attempts to connect to the internet. you can disable the auto-connect to internet feature.
Video_Games,B004MR3QY4,What is the difference with the black edition?,i think is colour and the light
Video_Games,B004MR3QY4,What is the difference with the black edition?,"Well, DPI on Black Edition is up to 3500 on infrarred sensor, while on the 2013 edition is up to 6400 DPI optical.

Video_Games,B004QRKWKQ,i need the reciever for play in pc?,"it comes with the controller, but i would suggest buying the 360 plug n play adapter made for the xbox 360, as that gives it a better rechargable battery pack instead of the double A batteries that come standard."

Video_Games,B004QRKWKQ,"In the ""i need the receiver for play in pc?"" question, somebody stated that it no longer comes with a receiver. Is this still the case?","It depends entirely on the seller. Based on the variety of answers (some getting receivers, some not) it is imperative that you check with the specific seller from whom you are purchasing the item. From the main listing, you can click a condition (""New"", ""Used"", etc.) to see a list of sellers. The second category is the condition notes - the only place the seller can indicate something like the receiver being included or not. If they do not indicate one way or the other, you can send a message directly to them to find out."
Video_Games,B004QRKWKQ,how does it recharge?,It does not come standard with a rechargeable battery.  You need either 2xAA batteries (which can be rechargeables if you want-I use eneloops myself) or the Microsoft rechargeable battery pack and the play/charge cable.

Video_Games,B0050SYK44,Is this game enjoyable to play as a single player game?,"It's fun in single player, and you aren't technically limited much. Except that Team Play is where it shines and goes beyond other shooters. The different playable characters have many abilities that support each other and make the game really fun!  That being said as a single-player game it's still better than a host of other designed-to-be single player games."
Video_Games,B0050SYK44,what is the best person to use in the borderlands 2 game?,"They all have their strengths, it really comes down to how you want to play and who you think looks the coolest. Do you want to start as the quick elemental sorceress, the robot assassin, the jacked and crazy bezerker, or the more standard, but very adaptable soldier? And, each one allows a good amount of playstyle customization as you go. That's not even bringing up the downloadable mechromancer and psycho...

Video_Games,B00576U8CC,"For players who prefer to fight solo rather than with a crew or clan, is this game still enjoyable?","oh definitely.  Its just like playing other MMOs.  You don't need a crew to help out. Most or the objectives have people around doing the same missions.  There are some dungeon (kind of) modes, but you are able to solo most of them or just skip them. they are not even necessary for story play."

Video_Games,B0057WDE8Q,How easy is it to put custom artwork on this? Can't seem to find any tutorials for it,"Difficult.  The reason being is because in order to get artwork on properly, you would want to remove the buttons.  In order to do so though, you would need to desolder the buttons because this stick does not have quick disconnects.Best option would be to look into possibly getting a laminated label that it sticky at the bottom but those usually aren't great"
Video_Games,B0057WDE8Q,How easy is it to put custom artwork on this? Can't seem to find any tutorials for it,"Well, it doesn't have a plastic covering that you could just slip artwork into. With that said, you could easily just take some measurements and match them up using the ruler in photoshop and just glue it on or something. The plastic doesn't have any weird finish on it or anything so you should also be able to paint directly on it."

Video_Games,B006IR6NH8,How does this thing steer? does it attach to something or does it use an accelerometer? and will it work with most racing games?,It uses an accelerometer that maps the rotation axis. It will work with most racing games but you will have to set up the controllers manually on most.  There is a download available that let's the rpm leds work with games that supports them.
Video_Games,B006IR6NH8,Does this wheel need to be attached to some other unit? Or is what is advertised here all that is needed?,"It works with accelerometers, so you don't need to attach it to anything at all, unless you want to."

And then you would use the Xbox 360 talkback cable that comes with the X42 and run that cable from the headset to the adapter, which connects to the controller, for chat. So yes you can use it, but you are tethereed to the controller and you need to purchase an adapter. The only 100 percent wireless headset on the market for the Xbox One is the Stealth 500X."

Video_Games,B005OSFUZI,This may be a dumb question but is this is like a legitimate cable for recording guitar on a laptop? Not just for the game but fo recording software?,The drivers identify it as a microphone(the bulge in the cable is a tiny soundcard).

Video_Games,B0086UK7IQ,Are the buttons too close together for your thumb to accurately hit? It seems with 4 rows of keys it might be easy to hit multiple at the same time.,the real drawback is accidentally pressing any thumb key when you use your thumb at all to help move the mouseotherwise they did a better job with the buttons than Razer did with their first generation of this sort of mouseits pretty easy to feel which key is which with your thumb and to accurately press just that... with some training of course.and it is unlikely you will intend to press one key and get 2 or 3 or 4 instead

In the gaming community, wireless is unacceptable -- time lag, etc. This keyboard needs plugging into both USB2 and electricity. It even prefers a USB port on the computer itself, not on a hub.

However, the G19 is a DAMN good K/B and the screen's useful for more than gaming. For a power-user like myself, this thing is heaven to use, whether gaming or typing papers.

Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Is it all strictly PvP or is there some PvE as well?,It's almost all PvE - the PvP is optional.
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Is it all strictly PvP or is there some PvE as well?,"The majority of the world is PvE and is probably about what you'd expect from a massively multiplayer Elder Scrolls world. The world is pretty huge and divided into three sections -- one for each alliance (Daggerfall, Ebonheart, Aldmeri). They meet around Cyrodiil, which is a massive PvP/war zone. Everything inside Cyrodiil (including PvE quest hubs and dungeons) is all open to PvP. There is no PvP outside of Cyrodiil."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Is it all strictly PvP or is there some PvE as well?,Alot of PVE mainly but it does support a decent amount of pvp so far.
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Is it all strictly PvP or is there some PvE as well?,"There is PvE, but it does not feel like a TES game, more like a generic MMO where you can only wander so far before being killed by enemies of a higher level. The PVP is what will keep players subscribing though. If you're expecting to explore a large world like you do in the single player Elder Scrolls games, you will be pretty disappointed."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Is it all strictly PvP or is there some PvE as well?,"There is some of both PvP is kind of week/poor and optional something to do if bored, and it's lacking any proper end game / elder game for PvE but it's mainly PvE focused just not the greatest PvE."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,"Is there a,way to play offline",Nope it's an MMO so there is no offline mode.
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,"Is there a,way to play offline",No this is an online MMO game
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,"Is there a,way to play offline","The game is 100% online, that said, there are hundreds of hours of content a solo player can play through.  Also, MMO's always have more content incoming, and typically subscription MMO content gets better over time.  As a subscription MMO, the game includes 30 days of play time.  To access it, you have to create a game account and attach a subscription payment means that can be validated (like a CC) to access those 30 days."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,"Is there a,way to play offline","Nope, if you are looking for an offline Elder Scrolls experience grab Skyrim, which is about $20 on Amazon.  Great game!"
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,What is the difference between this one and Skyrim?,"This is an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online). You will be in the world with other real people. Sometimes, it can be a good thing or a bad thing. Most of the mechanics are the same as Skyrim. In ESO, you can do PvP (Player vs. Player), where you fight against real people and not just NPCs (or AI). You cannot do PvP in Skyrim. And, for ESO, you have to pay a subscription fee of $15/month on top of the MSRP $60 for the game to purchase. ESO is an MMO meaning it can potentially go forever, whereas Skyrim had an end!"
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,What is the difference between this one and Skyrim?,"Skyrim was a single player sandbox rpg, while it had a set storyline, you could avoid it all together and still enjoy the game where as ESO's storyline is somewhat linear while there are many different paths and decisions to make and make different order to the quests. If you're expecting an online skyrim, then you'll be disappointed. But it's still a beautiful world to explore."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,What is the difference between this one and Skyrim?,"Skyrim was an awesome single player game...ESO is an MMO, and is sadly rather poorly executed at that."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,What is the difference between this one and Skyrim?,"Skyrim is a single player role playing game and Elder Scrolls:Online is a Massively multiplayer online role-playing game. In Skyrim you play by yourself with a character you create; in ESO you play by yourself or with friends or with other players you meet within the game. The quests are about the same, some more difficult than others. Imagine Skyrim with other players doing other quests while you do your quests and then some of those people getting together with you to do quests together and share the rewards. It's kind of like that."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Does the game come with the typical initial 1st month free?,"Buying the game does give you a month of free play but some players have had difficulty redeeming the free 30 days. Verified credit card information is required before you can play and payment methods like GiroPay, WebMoney, iDeal, and Paysafe are no longer allowed."
Video_Games,B0081Q58AW,Does the game come with the typical initial 1st month free?,"Yes, but... you have to supply a credit card and sign up for a monthly subscription to get the 30 days."

Video_Games,B00HLT0YT0,Why is this 100 dollars cheaper than a Vita without any games?,"It's cheaper because most of the prices you see over $200 are for people selling them above the MSRP.

From the EU version, it seems like Campaign Pack 1 (with Shigechi and Kira) is already out, while Campaign Pack 2 will be out May 14, most likely including Fugo and Iggy.

Using the adapter the X1 sends audio to the adapter and then you can plug in what you want as headphones. If you have headphones with a mic it also should work with chat and game audio. But check forums to be sure.
Video_Games,B00IAVDOS6,Would this work with any headphones like beats or apple headphones?,"No, this only works with CTIA headphones. Most headphones will work, but apple and beats both are not CTIA."

However, you may be able to find 3.5mm joiners that can combined the two cables into 1. You have to research and make sure you get an adapter with enough contacts in the right spots to ensure everything gets joined and sent through properly."

You can rest easy with this software because it was designed specifically with Razer products in mind. The software allows for many other things like DPI options. If you mean the ability to swap left and right click, then that is a feature built into Windows, so you can change it through control panel. Not entirely sure about other Operating Systems though."

The best thing to do is add Offine/Co-Op Mode but with somethings limit in these's modes like getting powerful gear, free company, and housing.
