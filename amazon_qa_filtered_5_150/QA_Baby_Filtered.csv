Baby,B00422M5AU,Does this go farther up or is it able to fold down to cover or not cover the arms?,"you have to roll it over onto itself otherwise it zips all the way up...keeping it rolled over if it's a small tuck n roll can be tough...even with that, it's still the best winter protection for Britax strollers for your lil one."
Baby,B0043G8OXC,"Can you leave this charging and on all night, or do you have to remove it from the charging station to turn it on as a night light?","You cannot charge and use it simultaneously. If it's on when it's charging, the battery will become damaged."

Baby,B0043G8OXC,"Is there an easy way to turn it on, in the middle of the night, for diapering and feeding?",It's easy to turn on - just push the button but it's probably not bright enough for diapering...should be ok for feeding.
Baby,B0043G8OXC,"Is there an easy way to turn it on, in the middle of the night, for diapering and feeding?",There is a small button on the bottom of the light.
Baby,B0043G8OXC,How long is the battery time if leaving it on?,"Hello Chloe. The KinderGlo will typically last between 8 and 12 hours depending upon several factors.  Color mode and battery condition (how well charged the lamp is and the age of the lamp) both affect the use time. Color cycling mode uses slightly more power than a constant color mode, so the light will last for slightly less time on this setting.We hope this is helpful!"
Baby,B0043G8OXC,How long is the battery time if leaving it on?,8-10 hours.You can find more info on the manufacturers website  http://kinderglo.com/product-features/thanksKenny

Baby,B0043G8OXC,Is there a way to reset the night light? The Dino stopped working last night. No red light when charging doesn't turn on.,"Yes, you can reset the light. The reset button is a tiny hole on the bottom of the lamp near the light button that can be pressed with a small, thin object such as a paperclip or the point of a pencil.In the event of any issues with the lamp, you can contact us for support at hello@kinderglo.com."

Baby,B0047GNVR2,does this base fit the Graco Alano Classic Connect Travel System?,"Graco has a chart outlining which seats match which bases. Some of the non-functional design elements have changed on the bases, so they may not look the same, even though they are compatible.http://www.gracobaby.com/pages/basecompatibility.aspx"

Baby,B004CLBX8G,does this gate have the ability to stay open or is it an automatically closing gate?,It can stay open.  It doesn't self close.
Baby,B004CLBX8G,does this gate have the ability to stay open or is it an automatically closing gate?,It can stay open.
Baby,B004CLBX8G,does this gate have the ability to stay open or is it an automatically closing gate?,It stays open!  Has been great!
Baby,B004CLBX8G,does this gate have the ability to stay open or is it an automatically closing gate?,It will stay open. Not automatically closing.
Baby,B004CLBX8G,Are pressure-mount hardware included with this gate or is it only to be used with permanent/screw mounts?,Only permanent screws (preferably upgraded over what comes with the package). The unique design of these gates does away with any permanent cross bar that has to be stepped over. That is a plus. The down side is that there is no way to put a tension bar across the opening or it would defeat the design.
Baby,B004CLBX8G,Are pressure-mount hardware included with this gate or is it only to be used with permanent/screw mounts?,It only came with screws and NOT any pressure-mounting devices.  It is a well constructed gate if you can find a way to securely attach it.
Baby,B004CLBX8G,How wide is it?,"This gate fits openings from 25"" to 40"" wide and is fully adjustable between those sizes.  The high and wide gate fits openings up to 58"" and is equally adjustable.  Top and bottom brackets and hinge blocks screw to the door frame.  The gate fittings simply drop onto them.  Width is easy to adjust and permanently set.  Piece of cake."
Baby,B004DC9OBM,is it hard to take down?,"Not bad at all. It is a little hard to lock the ends when putting up. be sure to break the sides down, then pull the middle part up. Breaks down fine."
Baby,B004DC9TEY,How much do the seats recline?,close to all the way down.
Baby,B004DC9TEY,How does this version compare to the Ironman dual version for serious running?,"There is only one negative to this stroller: the permanently locked wheel. Everything else is stellar and easily trail capable. But because of the locked wheel, it's too cumbersome to use everyday. If you only want it for running it can't be beat, you need a locked wheel for that anyway."
Baby,B004ECJWK4,Would this work on a swinging door?,"This lock works by catching on to part of the door frame. If there is no frame, there's nothing for it to hold on to."
Baby,B004ECJWK4,Would this work on a swinging door?,"To stop fingers from being smashed it would work....because you're essentially putting it on backwards, using it as a ""door can open but not close all the way"" tool.   If you want it to hold a door shut, it needs to have the jam to clip onto when it swings to the shut position.  Just like the picture shows, it will actually clip to that jam, so you can't open the door without breaking the device or pulling the lever to open it."
Baby,B004ECJWK4,Would this work on a swinging door?,"Yes, it would. It has stoppers for both sides of the door, and can be opened from either side."
Baby,B004EWG4ZA,"Debating on this mattress, or the Sealy Soybean Foam-Core. Anyone wish they bought the Foam-Core instead?","Dont know the other mattress, but happy with this one although it does show where baby sleeps already only after 6 months use..."

There is a dial that you turn to be able to extend it and it is kind of like a timer and clocks back until it gets to lock mode. This gate worked great for us, but if you install above the baseboards and they are really high your kiddo or pets will discover how to crawl under it."

Baby,B000YQMWLU,"Better to be really snug fit around nipple or have a little extra room in there? Tried on two sizes, not sure which to get more of.","It's better to have a snug fit. First, if there is too much room there is more air in the shield and your baby will have to suck air before they get any milk, which makes a gassy, cranky baby. Second, the snug fit means that when baby latches it will have more contact with the actual nipple and keep up stimulation so you won't lose as much milk production. Even if it's a snug fit it will still protect your nipple from abrasion, but if it's too big you will find it harder to switch baby back to breast later."

Baby,B001QKGN0E,will it work in a heavy residential security door?,"If you can swing without too much resistance, it probably can. The way it is designed, you can wind it up for more tension. It was probably meant for lighter doors but if the door can swing without too much effort or resistance, this probably would work."
Baby,B001QKGN0E,will it work in a heavy residential security door?,"That depends on what you want it to do. It will keep the door mostly closed, but it is unlikely that the door will close all the way. Being on the hinge side of the door it takes quite a bit of torque to latch the door. If you need the door to close all the way you should probably look in to a commercial closer."

These are the features that are located behind the headrest or behind the seat or on the floor behind the seat.

Baby,B002UP3FB4,Can this seat be used in vehicles that only have lap belts?,It has the usual tether clip and the two clips that fasten into the bar that runs along the inside back of the rear seat.

Baby,B002VBXY40,Is there a way to adjust the height for when baby gets taller?,There is a space under the seat that has a strap you can snap together which raises the baby just a little .. Perfect tho because it makes them keep trying to walk with out 100% supporting them :)

Would a flat spring support from another standard full-size crib fit this crib?,"It would be the same size, however the fiberboard support system is hinged on one side with locking clips on the opposite side.

Baby,B001Q1E83M,good night .. this team is for newborn babies? how heavy the product and the extent of the box,not for new born for baby who can sit by himself. Very light about 1pound and not to big probably 25cm around. You may check the wide of skate.
Baby,B001Q1E83M,"Good morning, until age can use this car??",Untill you feel your child doesnt need stroller anymore.
Baby,B003VB49PM,Is this a genuine Ergo?  Any proof?,"Many, if not most, of the Ergos sold here are fakes. It's a real shame that Amazon is willing to turn a blind eye to illegal products that put children in danger. Sure, they are happy to offer refunds to anyone who realizes they got a fake, but there are thousands of people out there using dangerous fakes they bought from Amazon, not realizing they are."
Baby,B003VB49PM,Would this work for a newborn?,This will work for a newborn if you purchase the insert for newborn is available with the carrier.
Baby,B003VB49PM,Would this work for a newborn?,"Newborns can be put in an Ergo, but you need the newborn insert to add to the carrier, and they need to be worn on your front only. Backpack and side carries need to wait until baby has good head control"
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Do you need to wear a bra?,"Yes! But you can use it without a bra too. This can still works if you wear something like a tank top or something little tight, the idea is you need something to hold it against your breast."
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Do you need to wear a bra?,"Yes, the bra helps hold it in place."
Baby,B001SMBRWO,IS it good to use at Night?,"No, do not use it at night for two reasons: It is not supposed to be worn for longer than the time it takes to nurse your baby (because after the milk collects in the milk-saver, it needs to be refridgerated). And also, the milk-saver has no top on it, so once the milk collects, if you were to bend over or lay down, all the milk would spill out."
Baby,B001SMBRWO,can you sleep with this product?,"Ugh, no, don't do that. You'll waste all of your wonderful precious milk!  The ocolette nursing cups are good for sleeping in."
Baby,B001SMBRWO,can you sleep with this product?,No.  That is the only downfall of this product.  It will spill out when you lay down or bend over forward.
Baby,B001SMBRWO,can you sleep with this product?,No. It's only for use while feeding. You put it on one side as baby feeds on the other and it catches whatever you leak.
Baby,B001SMBRWO,can you sleep with this product?,It would spill out.
Baby,B001SMBRWO,can you sleep with this product?,No they would leak out the top. They are only designed for catching milk if sitting upright while nursing. Plus they are far too bulky even if you could find a way to trap the milk.
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Do they come in a pair? And would just one pair be enough? How many are recommended?,"Only one comes in the package, unless you buy 2 on purpose.  All you really need is one, and depending on the day it can help tremendously or help very little.  The milkie is mostly just one on the breast while your little one is on the other side, then switch.  Eventually he'll drink the other one dry where it won't even leak anymore and you won't have to switch it."
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Do they come in a pair? And would just one pair be enough? How many are recommended?,no it's just one. If you require both sides YES get a pair. But i only had one side that was out of control with a forced let down.
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Would these be something you can wear if you think you won't be able to pump for a few hours? Do they show under the shirt?,"These would definitely be noticeable under a shirt... Also, there's only one in the box. It works great for nursing at home... And to use if you can only pump one side at a time.  Just put it in the side you're not feeding from and it will catch the milk that lets down. Most useful during the few first months before your body learns to only let down on one side. (Used to ""catch"" about 2oz/day)"
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Would these be something you can wear if you think you won't be able to pump for a few hours? Do they show under the shirt?,These would show under a shirt. There are some smaller ones that wouldn't show as much.
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Would these be something you can wear if you think you won't be able to pump for a few hours? Do they show under the shirt?,"You could where it under your shirt, but it is very big and bulky.  If you had a sweatshirt or jacket on then maybe people wouldn't be able to tell, but with just a shirt on you can definitely tell.  Not ideal for the workplace, but good at home or while feeding or pumping you can wear it on the other side."
Baby,B001SMBRWO,Any chance you can wear these while sleeping?,"No, not really...unless you sleep sitting up. The way they're designed is for the milk to drip down into the basin...it would spill out while sleeping.  But that would be a great invention!!"
Baby,B001WAJVZM,would this fit on a spout where the diverter is the underside of the faucet that pull down?,It will undoubtedly fit on but whether it will stay on or not is another question...It relies on the pull up type with the button at exactly the right distance from the front.
Baby,B001WAJVZM,Does it protect your child from hiting the bottom of the faucet...it looks open at bottom,"Yes.  It has to be open at the bottom for the water to fill the bathtub.  However, the whale comes down below the faucet about a half inch to an inch.  That extra coverage means the metal of the faucet is covered.  It has saved us from hitting the bottom twice."

Baby,B001WAJVZM,does the water spout from the top of whale? or flow down to from under whale to be functional?,From the bottom.  It doesn't change the way the water comes out.  That hole at the top is for the thing at the top of the spout that turns the shower on....whatever that's called....

Baby,B00278WA4W,Do these cups come with a cover/lid to go over the spout?,"No, but they do not leak. They require suction for the liquid to come out."
Baby,B00278WA4W,"Is this 2 packages, each with 2 cups (for a total of 4 cups), or is the total 2 cups?","The total is two cups.  (The tops screw on quite easily, by the way.)"
Baby,B00278WA4W,Is the spout a hard or soft chewable plastic?,It's a harder plastic spout.
Baby,B00278WA4W,Is the spout a hard or soft chewable plastic?,"The spout is hard.  And very smooth.  (Note also that it does require some strong sucking to draw liquid out of the bottle;  the manufacturer touts this as a plus, saying it helps train babies to suck successfully at the breast.)"
Baby,B00278WA4W,Is the spout a hard or soft chewable plastic?,Spout is hard and has stood up to much chewing!
Baby,B00278WA4W,Is the spout a hard or soft chewable plastic?,The plastic is hard.

Baby,B002968T5G,Does this Bra work with the Avent Comfort Pump?,It probably will work with any pump. You need to be able to fit the front or the back part of the flanges through the bra openings. The fabric is stretchy so probably any pump part would fit through.
Baby,B002968T5G,What's the difference between this bra and the simple wishes d lite hands free breast pump bra?,This bra comes with a two inch-wide extension that you attach to the front with zippers if you need it.  The d-lite bra does not come with this extension.

The gasket has grooves in it that the liquid comes through, but only when there is sucking.  You know it's tight enough just by tightening it all the way-it doesn't click or anything.  They really are great, though-no straws to deal with when you're on the go!"
Baby,B0062BVY42,How does it work?  How do you know when you have the lid on tight enough?,"The lid has a soft, silicone edge with small grooves in it.  As you tighten the lid down, the silicone gets ""squished"" and less liquid comes out.  To increase the flow, you loosen the lid a small amount and ""un-squish"" the silicone part.It is kind of trial and error to see when you have the lid on tight enough."
Baby,B0062BVY42,How does it work?  How do you know when you have the lid on tight enough?,Works great. Just make sure gasket has the ridges facing out and just hand tighten the lid. It has never leaked on us so far. Hope this helps. If not just ask whatever other questions you may have. Good luck

Or an additional one for purchase for another vehicle?,"No, it is a convertible seat, not an infant seat to use it between 2 cars you would have to take the whole seat out and install it in the other car.

Baby,B00H8MSKAU,"Can a 2 month old, 12 lb baby fit securely and tightly in this?",yes. this seat is designed to fit newborn through toddler. the lowest seat adjustment plus cushioned inserts give a lot of support for a newborn. the only downside i would say for a small baby is that there is not handle so this seat cannot be carried around through a store or something if baby is sleeping.

If you are concerned about whether you have enough overhang on the table, you need to add another full inch to accommodate the total length of the clamp that fits under the counter...you need 4.5 -5.0 of clearance under the counter.  This counter seat/chair is very nice, very sturdy and very durable.  Hope this helps.  Edward"

Otherwise it would seem like such a waste of the bags.,Registered nurse once told us that to throw the food away once it has come in contact with baby's saliva.

Baby,B00005V6C8,Can you use regular trash bags or non-Diaper Dekor brand liners?,The top opens and inside looks like a regular trash can. There is a lip on the inside that allows you to fold the edges  of a regular trash bag over so that the bag does not move or slide down. Just change the bag as frequently as you see fit. It would seem that if you are creative and want to save money then this is the way to go.
Baby,B00005V6C8,Can you use regular trash bags or non-Diaper Dekor brand liners?,"If you just wanted to use the unit as a holder for a trash bag, yes. The Dekor brand liners are rolled and sized to fit in the top part of the unit, and pull down to create the next bag, with a cutter on the inside of the door. If you are looking for a trash bag holder for any bag, this unit would be cumbersome, used in that manner."
Baby,B00005V6C8,Can you use regular trash bags or non-Diaper Dekor brand liners?,"No, the replacement bag for the system fits the width and has no end... You keep cutting the edge as it is full and tying the end to make a new bottom for the bag."
Baby,B00005V6C8,"Is this markedly different than buying a hands-free trash bin? What about the ""system"" cuts down on smell in a special way? Two levels of openings?","Yes there are two openings. On the inside there is a ring like plastic thing that holds the bags and has its own cover. This is what reduces the smell because it in effect ""seals"" the inside. It works really well, too. You do have to follow the directions to get it set up correctly"
Baby,B00005V6C8,Can you use munchkin arm & hammer 'snap' bags with this pail?,"Probably not, they have bags that are for this specific pail, they are easy to use."

Baby,B00006408K,Can this be hang on the side of pack n play?,This particular model can not. The PRINCE LIONHEART DIAPER DEPOT- smaller version but hangs onside of changing table or pack/play. If you can't find it on Amazon then Toys R Us has it for $14.99. Hope this helps

Baby,B00006408K,would this diaper holder work well for an adult that uses depends. Need something to sit on a tv tray beside a potty seat,"It might fit them, the openings are a little tight. If the depends are wider then the diaper i do not believe they will fit, because it's still a tight fit for diapers. However, i did order this too, and the slots are removable so this might be better for you then the lionheart. Delta Children 2 Count Nursery Organizer Bin Set, Blue (Discontinued by Manufacturer)"

Baby,B0000DBHHR,"Will this gate work with baseboards?  The doorway is 30 inches wide at the baseboards, and 32 inches wide at the wall above the baseboards.","it depends on how you're going to use it. If you'll use the pressure option, yes, you can just mount it higher. If you're planning on mounting it to the wall, you'll need to cut part of the baseboard."
Baby,B0000DBHHR,"Will this gate work with baseboards?  The doorway is 30 inches wide at the baseboards, and 32 inches wide at the wall above the baseboards.",Yes. It will either sit above or you can screw the pads at the bottom to compensate.

Baby,B0002Z9L7G,Do you have to attach it to the seat belt every time you put your seat belt on or does it stay on once attached?,The clip stays on belt but you need attach the portion of the belt that is rubbing your neck. Kind of just keeps the belt out of the way but seems to work good so far
Baby,B0002Z9L7G,Do you have to attach it to the seat belt every time you put your seat belt on or does it stay on once attached?,"It stays attached to the lap seat belt strap.  When you put the seat belt on, you loop the shoulder seat belt through the CommuteMate and you are done.  If you do not want to use it, it can stay on the lap seat belt and does not need to be detached.  This is good if another, larger, person also drives your car."
Baby,B0002Z9L7G,Do you have to attach it to the seat belt every time you put your seat belt on or does it stay on once attached?,it stays attached. thankfully b/c it's very hard to get off once you attach it. not meant for moving around. you just have to hook your seat belt in each time you get in. it's really simple.

You get the longest use out of them this way, since with this fold the width doesn't matter and they'll fit lengthwise a long time (the infant size will get you from birth to over a year easily--get the 4x8x4 for better absorbency). If you want to fold them the old-fashioned way, you'll need to secure them either with pins or a snappi/pair of boingos...but you'll also need to buy more sizes as the baby outgrows the width."

To do diaper changes you will need to turn the monitor off and remove it from the diaper before you change the diaper-- remember to turn it off, or the time it spends on the table (not moving) will make the alarm sound!"
Baby,B002ITOC7S,Can this monitor be used once the baby starts moving around in bed and rolling over to belly?,Absolutely!

Baby,B002QZ64T8,Can these be used with diaper rash cream (zinc oxide or aquaphor) to keep it off of the cloth diapers?,"Yes and No. If these liners stay in place then they would do an excellent job shielding the cloth diaper from the rash cream. However many times they will move, wrinkle depending on how active your baby is and then it may not offer that kind of protection.I have two recommendations for you - Buy a microfleece cloth by the yard from any hobby store (Joanne, Hobby Lobby etc.) and cut them to the size that suits you best. They work the same way and you won't burn your pocket. Also Grandma El's diaper cream has worked very well for us."

If your baby is small enough maybe 12 lbs or less, as long as you have them in there so they can't roll around it may be OK to move them short distances, but nothing like up and down stairs. The movement will not be smooth since it will be bouncing off of yourself while carrying it. Maybe 2 people moving it will be smoother."

You should get an infant car seat for the first year, and move the baby in / out of the car with that car seat.  Babies are fragile and you don't want to be pulling and tugging too much at them."
Baby,B005WH3R9M,Does this work with newborn right out of hospital?,Yes it comes with the extra padding for newborns like the other infant carriers
Baby,B005WHQL40,Does this carseat recline in the rear facing position?,"According to the instructions when installed rear facing the feet are flipped under the seat which places it in the ""reclined"" position.  When facing forward the feet are flipped down which positions the seat more upright."
Baby,B005WHQL40,Does this carseat recline in the rear facing position?,"i didnt see any way to make it recline, but now i'm reading other answers about ""feet"" at the bottom, so maybe i will take another look, just out of curiosity.  i have a 4 door sedan (toyota camry) and it hits the suggested angle without outside help. as far as i know, it does not recline and if you need to change the angle, you  have to use towels or something at the bottom to adjust it."

Very good carseat - no complaints from us - and infactbought a 2nd one for Grandparents to use in their car."

Baby,B006MVHCN4,Is this product sprayed with a chemical flame retardant?,"Just wanted to mention: PBDE is NOT the only chemical flame retardant. The fact that the email quoted below does not state that Oeuf pads are free of TDCPP or other known carcinogens, when combined with the fact that they contain urethane foam, means they probably do contain flame retardants."
Baby,B006MVHCN4,"Is it really 32.5"" long? Some reviews say it is actually longer. Trying to fit a smaller BabyLetto change table and am concerned with length.","Hi, just went to baby's room and measured the length for you, and yes it is accurate 32.5"""

The UK even has 240V in their outlets, so maybe Gyoungok lives somewhere where they have 220V."

Baby,B006PB2BLE,Is this seat approved for use in the EU?,Can you define EU?

Baby,B006WHR6CU,how do you open the lid,"You just screw it off and on, which is where the ""click"" sound happens.  The lid is two pieces, so in the case of the green cup, the blue part is the lid and the purple part is the silicone spout that you have to wedge in and out for wash and use, and it's kind of a pain.  The whole thing then screws right onto the green cup."
Baby,B006WHR6CU,how do you open the lid,"just twist it opened. when you close it, you will hear a snap sound. it's a little difficult to wash these though.

Baby,B006WHR6CU,does theses click. lock sippy cup come with leak proof valve cuz the 8 bottles i have all have broken opening valves. do you sell replacements?!!!,"You actually don't want a sippy that would be very hard for a baby/ or child to get liquids from.  The mouth does not need to learn to suck and this can be detrimental, if it's always the way he/ she is drinking.  There is current research on this but it's a newer finding in the last couple of years. There are speech problems from them and palette formation issues.  Experts now suggest they only be used during a transition period between bottle and cup. It may be worth it to keep those kids carpets around until they're old enough to use cups without frequent spills."

Baby,B00G3XR9MU,Is the car seat adapter convenient and easy to use or kind of awkward and bulky?,"It's convenient to use as it can stay attached to the pram at all times, even when folding and folded up. You can attach the capsule easily, then attach the strap (which is not difficult, but it is a  2 stage process). It's not as convenient as a travel system with an individual adapter for your capsule (as this is a one fits most adapter), but the plus is you can have a Baby Jogger stroller after your baby is finished in the capsule (around 6 months)."

Baby,B000CSEE3O,How much more height does this give the child?  It looks like this seat is only about 2-3 inches taller than a normal seat.,"It's definitely very low to the ground and meant as only a booster, so it worked really well on an adult sized chair.

However during the 5th month the infant can sleep in any position he/she is comfortable sleeping in because development improves.

You attach them to the wall then the pressure mounting adjusters fit in them and you tighten them up. That stops them from sliding back and forth at all. Hope that makes sense.

Baby,B0040MN2EU,What is the actual outside diameter of these Wall Savers? Also how thick are they (by what amount is the opening reduced where gate is installed)?,"Outside diameter is about 4.5"".

The urine goes right through it.  They are intended to catch the bowel movement so it's easier to dump it out of the cloth diaper.
Baby,B00483GAJU,"Are these liners absorbent? If so, how do the compare to a cloth insert or a disposable diaper?",These are not diaper inserts. They are liners (think coffee filter like) that you place between the diaper and baby's skin to make cleaning up BMs much easier.

A flat surface gives you a completely sealed mat - nothing gets under it. The height of your texture will impact the seal you get.  So if you are more concerned about creating a non slip surface - it will meet your needs. If you are buying to eliminate the build up that you get with standard bath mats - the height of your texture will determine if you can get an airtight seal. If you do not have an airtight seal - water and soap residue will get under the mat.

For children of any Strength (weight) that chair?,"Oh, and it doesn't rear face, so this seat would be best for a child over 2 that has outgrown their rear facing seat.

Baby,B00BEVF1W6,Britax Frontier 90 сan be set in the middle (center) of the rear seats? Or only the sides? For children of any Strength (weight) that chair?,"Yes it can be set in the middle seat.

Baby,B00DNQS6PO,Biggest criticism with Baby Bjorn carrier is backache that occurs in parents using it. Does this model address this issue?,"No, backache is still a problem. The baby carrying ""slot"" is separated from the adult's body by an interior piece of fabric connected to the shoulderstraps, therefore replacing the weight that should be resting directly on the adult's body, with weight bearing on their hips, and replacing that portion of weight on the shoulders. By connecting the inner part of the carrier to the shoulder straps rather than the outer part of the carrier, the center of gravity for the child is much farther away from the adult's body, making the adult overadjust with their shoulders and back."

Still safe, if you have the correct style seats in you car."

Baby,B004FI2P88,"Is there something that mounts permanently to the outside of the cabinet, or just the magnet on the inside?","Nothing on the outside. Two pieces are mounted on the inside, one on the door frame one on the cabinet frame. You use the part that looks like a key to open door. Just slide it on the outside, you will hear a little click and it will open! Check out some of the YouTube videos, they help"
Baby,B004FI2P88,"Is there something that mounts permanently to the outside of the cabinet, or just the magnet on the inside?",There is a small piece that mounts on the inside of the cabinet and then the larger piece with magnet mounts to the door of the cabinet.
Baby,B004FI2P88,"Is there something that mounts permanently to the outside of the cabinet, or just the magnet on the inside?","There is not a permanent mount to the outside of the cabinet. The lock system has one magnetic lock, a latch (both screw into the inside of the cabinet with short screws) and a magnetic key. The key releases the lock when it is placed over the lock from the outside of the cabinet. Does that help?"

Baby,B004FI2P88,"Can a person use a regular magnet to unlock, or does it need to be the Safety First ""key"" magnet?",You have to use a strong magnet... magnet rocks work for us

Especially drawers that are not very high, so there's no clearance for a drill or short screwdriver.","If you can take the drawer out and have enough clearance to set the latch inside the frame, you could put the locking mechanism in the drawer and reinstall it.

Baby,B004FI2P88,"Could these be installed for drawers? Especially drawers that are not very high, so there's no clearance for a drill or short screwdriver.","It's hard to know without seeing the drawers.  Depending on the type of drawer and the frame around it, it might be possible to put the latch at the side so you'd be drilling horizontally instead of vertically."
Baby,B004FI2P88,"Could these be installed for drawers? Especially drawers that are not very high, so there's no clearance for a drill or short screwdriver.","Like the previous 2 answers, you have to be able to drill a few holes to install this item, it seems it won't work for your drawers."
Baby,B004FI2P88,"Would these locks secure cabinet doors closed with enough force to hold snug against weatherstrip, creating a strong seal?",It's a solid latch. Can't think of why it would not hold against weather strip. Make sure weather strip is already on when using the screw template or test how snug you want it by pressing

Baby,B004FI2P88,Does this come with a template for installation?,"It does come with one, once you figure it out its easy."
Baby,B004FI2P88,Does this come with a template for installation?,Yes. One non-reusable template for each lock. The template has a clever procedure for transferring from the cabinet to the door/drawer to ensure the pieces line up. It's still important to double check the marks made with the template before drilling holes.
Baby,B004FI2P88,Does this come with a template for installation?,Yes. It's a sticker you drill the holes right through; works like a charm.
Baby,B004FI2P88,Does this come with a template for installation?,"Yes, quite a few"
Baby,B004FI2P88,"Has anyone tried using the product on small sliding doors? For example, the doors on a wooden TV stand, thanks in advance.","Won't work unless you build out a ""L"" type of piece in the back and attach the item there.  Still may be an issue.

Baby,B004FKPZBA,does it fit newborns?,Ummmm....kinda. You will need to wait until the meconium is done (you'll never get those stains out) and there is the umbilical cord to be careful of too. They aren't snug enough at that early stage to stop blow outs. But they will hold the tiny amounts of urine from your newborn. Until the thighs fatten up a bit (about a month old or so) they don't work that great. Besides you might not be ready for that amount of laundry until then too. Hope that helps God bless you and your little one!
