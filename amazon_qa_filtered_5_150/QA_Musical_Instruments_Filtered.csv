Musical_Instruments,B0002GZM00,does it need a one spot or can it use a normal 9v plug?,The left most end as shown in the photo has a female connector. This connector should work for any 9v adapter that fits a standard pedal.I actually use it with a high current zoom 9v adapter.
Musical_Instruments,B0002H0GF0,Is this possible to just play and not connect it on the computer ?,"No, this is only a controller. You need to connect it to a computer with music/instrument software or a MIDI-compatible instrument (like a synthesizer)."
Musical_Instruments,B0002H0GF0,Is this possible to just play and not connect it on the computer ?,Unless you have other midi hardware it will have to be connected to a computer...
Musical_Instruments,B0002H0GF0,"Looking primarily to learn piano, but would sacrifice SFX of most boards to get midi; any downside to getting a midi to learn on?",Not at all. Most of the sound effects and things that you would eventually want will be available through software on your computer. Just note that this keyboard itself won't emit sound. Just MIDI commands. The sound will come from your computer.
Musical_Instruments,B0002H0GF0,Does it have a headphone port,"No.  the keyboard is a controller.  It has no sounds of it's own.  Therefore there is no audio out plug.  Only midi out.The audio out will come from the laptop, desktop or iPhone/iPod/iPad that you connect the board to.  That computer(or other) must have the instrument software.  You will also need headphones and or speakers."

Musical_Instruments,B0002IHGZC,Why wouldn't you just buy a powerstrip and plug each of your pedals into it?  Or a Visual Sound one plug that connects all the chained effects?,More even voltage and current flow then using adapter for pedal.  Also all the pedals plug in to it so less power adapter cables running on the floor
Musical_Instruments,B0002IHGZC,Why wouldn't you just buy a powerstrip and plug each of your pedals into it?  Or a Visual Sound one plug that connects all the chained effects?,because your pedals would burn up if you tried to plug them directly to 110volts? guitar pedals work on voltages ranging from 9V to 18V. this power supply cleans up the power and provides a regulated voltage to your pedals. also keeps your pedal board neat by not having to resort to using single wall wart type of power supplies for each pedal. you could use the visual sound 1 spot but it only provides 1 x 9v output. if you have pedals with different voltage requirements it wont work.
Musical_Instruments,B0002IHGZC,Is this item 240V ready? or does it only operate on 120V?,"bscepter is correct.  From the Voodoo Lab PP2+ Manual, ""Pedal Power units purchased in North America should only be powered from 120VAC.  Attempting to use 220-240VAC mains directly will cause permanent damage to your Pedal Power!  You must use an appropriate stepdown transformer.""However, they do offer models with voltage appropriate to various regional markets, such as a 230V 50/60Hz model for Europe and Australia, as indicated here:  http://www.voodoolab.com/pedalpower_2.htm (scroll down to the specs table)"
Musical_Instruments,B0002IHGZC,Is this item 240V ready? or does it only operate on 120V?,"i'm not sure. it doesn't have an external transformer, so it may just be 120v. if you go to their website and check, it looks as if they make models for specific markets: http://www.voodoolab.com/pedalpower_2.htm"
Musical_Instruments,B0002IHGZC,Is this item 240V ready? or does it only operate on 120V?,"According to Voodoo Lab the Pedal Power 2 Plus is available in 3 models. They offer one for North America (120vac in @ 50/60Hz), one for Japan (100vac in @ 60Hz) and one for Europe and Australia (230vac in @ 50/60Hz)."

Musical_Instruments,B0002KZQFC,"Does this pedal have a distortion mode, for metal power chord songs?","Yes. However, it is not called distortion.

Musical_Instruments,B0002KZQFC,"What other cables do you need with this, or do they suggest it in the manual--and does it get is power source from the amplifer (i am clueless)","You'll need at least another cable 1/4 (same size that you are already using for the guitar) and if you want to use it, there is an output to headphone too that you could use with no amp...."
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZQFC,"What other cables do you need with this, or do they suggest it in the manual--and does it get is power source from the amplifer (i am clueless)",You need a cable from the guitar to the pedal and the same type of corf from the pedal to the amp.

Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Slinky is just the name of the string. It references how bendable the string is. There isn't a ""non-slinky"" string, but it ranges from a very ""slinky"" gauge of string (lighter gauges), and the heavier gauges, which Ernie Ball calls their ""Not Even Slinky"" strings. The Regular Slinky pack (us guitarists call it a standard 10 gauge set) seems to have a good balance between tone and playability, which is why so many players prefer them."
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,what is the difference between slinky and non slinky?,"Slinky is just a line of strings from Ernie Ball, the ""Slinkier"" they are the thinner they are, regular Slinky are 10 gauge strings, super slinky are 9s, and ""Not Even Slinky"" strings are 12s (the number represents the gauge of the lightest string in the set)."
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,"Do all 6 strings come in the ""1 pack""?","All 6 of the strings are in the pack, they just put each string into its own paper envelope for easy identification. The ball-ends aren't color-coded like D'addario. Hope this helps. :)"
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,"Do all 6 strings come in the ""1 pack""?","yes, not to be rude but thats a pretty silly question :)"

Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,Do these work on any electric guitar?,No. These are magical strings. Only the chosen one may wield them.
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,Do these work on any electric guitar?,"ive used them on many different 6 string guitars, and there is a super slinky for any tone/play style that you want. if you are more into metal, get the super slinky"
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,"Would the ""not even"" strings be good for drop c and drop b tuning?","Ernie Ball's site says good for drop D and C, but does not mention B"
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,"Would the ""not even"" strings be good for drop c and drop b tuning?",no these are regular i bought not even slinky and there great just very thick its better for songs with harmonics too
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,"Would the ""not even"" strings be good for drop c and drop b tuning?",These should be good for what you are looking for.
Musical_Instruments,B0002M6CVC,"Would the ""not even"" strings be good for drop c and drop b tuning?","These are regular slinkys, but the ""not even slinkys"" are specifically built for drop tuning. You may still get some flubbing on a low B, but if you do, just get a thicker gauge of string."

The problem is, Jessica, that after you've unfolded the desk, it won't stay in place and support even a small book of sheet music unless the ledge is holding it in place. This also wouldn't be a problem, except that there's nothing to keep the ledge in place besides friction and gravity. You can't get the stand to hold the position you see in the picture. You have to put the ledge on the top, and rest the book on the bottom. Then it will only hold provided that you not touch it."

And will an old sony reciever work with this as a pre amp?,"This is not the type of amp to use for home audio, yes your speakers can handle the wattage, remember you want a lot of watts, not for noise but true solid sound at low output also. No your old sony receiver will not work as a preamp for this unit, it is a DJ style amp. Great to daisy chain, etc..

For anyone looking to replace them with better quality, don't get the Planet Waves you probably see listed on Amazon along with the PB600. They're great cables, they're just too big to fit between the pedals on this board...at least if you're using, for example, all Behringer pedals where all the jacks will be lined exactly up.

Musical_Instruments,B002LASBRG,Would this be a good microphone for a trumpet?,Yes it's works very well with instruments
Musical_Instruments,B002LASBRG,What is the difference between this and the V67G?,The R144 is a ribbon mic and not phantom powered - you must NOT apply phantom power. The V67G is a phantom powered condenser microphone. Different technologies altogether. The ribbon mic uses a aluminum ribbon for a sensing element and produces a warmer sound requiring a lot of gain from your mic pre. The condenser is very sensitive and provides much greater frequency coverage. You use a ribbon mic to tame harshness or to obtain a particular vocal quality richer than a condenser but less accurate.
Musical_Instruments,B002LASBRG,What is the difference between this and the V67G?,"Serious question? One is a ribbon mic, the other a large diaphragm condenser mic. The ribbon has limited frequency range, less volume, and a softer character as a result. The V67G has a wider frequency range, more volume, and a more aggressive character. The ribbon mic is good for guitars, the condenser is good for guitars, too, but at a distance, and especially good for vocal work or room mic-ing instruments."

You then plug yoor USB or XLR plug in to the mic directly."

Any ""special"" considerations?",You would use the ones that are designed to be outdoors and the connections should be soldered instead of the plugs otherwise you are just asking for trouble.  If you do not know how to do this hire an electrician that has worked with these.
Musical_Instruments,B002Q8V8DM,"Can these be use outdoors? Any ""special"" considerations?",No. They are not water resistant.
Musical_Instruments,B002Q8V8DM,"Can these be use outdoors? Any ""special"" considerations?","no, not listed for use. There are others however that are listed for outdoor use"

Musical_Instruments,B002QAUOKS,"hello, i wanted to make singing covers on youtube, but didnt know what kind of mic or other equipment to buy?","This is a really good mic, you can't go wrong for the price.  If you plan on recording directly to your computer you will need an audio interface. Focusrite and Presonus are two really good brands, they come with recording software and have built in pre amps.

Musical_Instruments,B002QK38GK,Will this fit under the top half of the violin in the compartment for the same in most standard violin cases?,"If you have a full size (4/4) violin yes the shoulder rest will fit in the case. If the case is any more small, the rest will not fit."
Musical_Instruments,B002QK38GK,will it work with a silent electric violin?,"It depends on the design of the instrument. Many electric violins will only take their proprietary shoulder and chin rests.If you're talking specifically about the Yamaha Silent Violins, it will work on them.  Many electrics have a frame that simulates the lower bout of a violin, and those will take any shoulder rest... same for any others that have a lower bout frame with the same dimensions as an acoustic violin."
Musical_Instruments,B002TREG34,Does this work with Acoustic Guitars?,"Not likely because the acoustic body is much wider than an electric, so the guitar won't clear the wall"
Musical_Instruments,B002TREG34,Would this work with a guitar with Straplocks installed? What type might work best? Schaller? Dunlop? Etc...,"Basically, the answer is yes! Dunlop Strap locks snap into the outside of the strap button, so that leaves the groove free to rest in the hanger, but you would still have pop the straplocks out, then hang the guitar and then reinsert the strap locks, if you wanted the strap attached while it is hanging. Otherwise, the simple answer, since both Schaller and Dunlop strap locks make it easy to take the strap off, just detach the strap before you hang it, then either will work on the Woodies Hanger."

Musical_Instruments,B0030GA1VO,How many dB is this amp?,"It really depends on several things. There are decibels clean and then after it starts to break up.

Musical_Instruments,B0036B8A20,"Will this amp drive a single Kustom PA monitor whos requirements are 60W RMS, 120W peak?",A short answer is yes but not very clearly even if the impedance load matches up.

Musical_Instruments,B0036R4SUW,is this actual string for pianos?,"It is ""music wire"" and should be fine on a piano for the higher notes that do not have wrapped strings.  It should also be fine for multiple string notes as long as the wire diameter is correct."

Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,will it work on a 4 string tenor banjo?,"Yes--definitely; tenor and plectrum as well. The tenor and plectrum bridges are just a little bit shorter than that of a 5 string bridge. It will fit perfectly and you will not be disappointed with the results. This mute will stay in place, even with the most vigorous strumming--in both performing solo or playing in band situations. Easy to store out of the way too--it'll just slide over two brackets on the side, and can be installed on the bridge in seconds when needed. Made from good materials too."
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Will this work on a 6-string banjitar?,"It might.  Don't count on it making it a lot quieter.  Take a piece of tubing 5\16 the or so, cut 6 slits in it in line with your strings and slide it on from the top of the bridge.  Lot more effective and just about free.  Look at a pic of a fiddle mute.  Kind of similar to that."
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Will this work on a 6-string banjitar?,"Yes because it slides over the bridge, adding mass so that the vibrations don't affect the drum like they normally do.  It is independent of the number of strings."
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Anyone use this in lieu of having to put a towel in resonator to prevent feedback when plugged in?,"No  all this does is dampen out vibrations, it does not absorb sound waves"
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Do the strings need to be loosened to install mute?,"No, the mute just slides over the bridge from the side.  You can take it on and off without changing anything else."
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Do the strings need to be loosened to install mute?,No. The mute slides snugly around the bridge just below the strings.
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Do the strings need to be loosened to install mute?,"No, the strings don't need to be loosened.  The mute is U-shaped and slides over the bridge itself.  There's a padded material in the middle of the mute so it can fit over a good range of bridge thicknesses."
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Do the strings need to be loosened to install mute?,No - it slides around the bridge just below the strings. super easy and doesn't involve any retuning
Musical_Instruments,B0041T4DK4,Do the strings need to be loosened to install mute?,"No,  just slide the mute onto the bridge beneath the strings.   It will also work on the ""moon"" bridges, that are rounded (compensated)."

Musical_Instruments,B004444OFK,Does it come with a case?,no case. they don't fold or anything and it would have to be a pretty big case. to be honest these headphones are a bad cause they distort on certain frequencies. even at low volumes. great separation of sounds but not clear all the time...

Musical_Instruments,B00452V2SI,Will it play back your recording at slower speeds like 1/2 speed?,"Yes it will go down to 1/2 speed (X 0.5), tried it last night, but you will experience some digital distortion almost like a reverb affect.

Musical_Instruments,B004OK17QS,Is this pedal 9v battery power also?,"As all the other replies said, does run on 9v battery, but you won't want to because of current draw, which is >100mA. That is much more than most analog pedals, and will kill a 9v battery after few hours of use. So use a standard 9V DC supply, or purchase one and/or cabling to connect all your pedals if you like (a la pedalboard)."

How many watts does it push for monitoring Sonar Playback for instance?,"The whole unit is USB powered, rated draw of 480 mA.  The headphone/monitor output is just for headphones (47 ohm output inpedance). Amplification would be needed for multiple headphones or other monitoring."
Musical_Instruments,B0054IKKXA,"does it accept line level input, e.g. from an amplifier aux out","The short answer is no. However, it does have an orange 3/4 coaxial input and output. If your amplifier has an S/PDIF output, then you should use that to connect to the coaxial input (which would give you high resolution audio). Otherwise, you will need to get an analog (RCA) to digital (coaxial) converter/adapter. It is important to note if the aux output is mono or dual, because the converter or adapter must correspond to this. These range in price from $2-40, with the adapters being the cheapest and easiest to use."

One reviewer said ""no MIDI I/O"",  another said it has a ""MIDI keyboard""","MIDI is the way the keyboard can talk to a computer.  The keyboard does not have a standard MIDI plug, but instead uses a USB port to connect to the computer with the same functionality.  It is better and cheaper and only really an issue if you are wanting to plug the keyboard into something very old.  Then you'd need a USB to MIDI cord....."
Musical_Instruments,B0059ZTYQM,"Don't play myself. This is for a grandchild.  What is MIDI, how does it work?  One reviewer said ""no MIDI I/O"",  another said it has a ""MIDI keyboard""","Lynn,MIDI is the way that the keyboard generates its sound (it's a technical protocol but just think of it as its software). I/O refers to an input/output connection. In other words, it's a normal keyboard that doesn't have a specialized jack that more advanced users (like professional music composers) might need. If what you want is to have is a keyboard with normal settings, sound, instruments, etc., then it fits the bill."

It does not have old school midi ports, only MIDI over USB. This means it can be used with computer programs like ""Playground sessions"" or other composing tools. But you are not required to use midi. It has its own speakers and is completely playable without ever needing to hook it up to a computer. Hope that helps."

Musical_Instruments,B005DSSZHO,how loud will two of these be?  loud enough for a block party?,"Sorry, too many variables here to respond meaningfully: size of block, number of attendees, ambient noise. One is certainly loud enough for a room that might accommodate 100 people, who are not in love with ear-blasting sound levels."
Musical_Instruments,B005DSSZHO,how loud will two of these be?  loud enough for a block party?,"That is really impossible to say for sure. How large of an area will you need to fill with sound? Is this for background music and announcements, or thumping music for dancing? If the former, they would probably be just enough. For the latter, it would not be nearly enough. For an outdoor system with powerful music, you will need a couple thousand watts of power and much larger speakers."
Musical_Instruments,B005DSSZHO,how loud will two of these be?  loud enough for a block party?,The unit has two channels. Each one is 50 watts. You can daisy chain them together to cover a larger area. Would it be loud enough for a block party? That depends on how big the block is and what kind of other noise is going on.

Musical_Instruments,B005FXLI30,Does these speakers come with the required wire to hook up to the laptop or ipad?,"No they don't.  You will need to buy a speaker wire with a 1/4"" end AND you'll have to buy an adaptor that has a male 1/4"" hole on one side and a 3.5mm hole on the other.

Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,Does your minilabs in stock come with the latest Arturia Analog Lab software or is this older stock?,"It doesn't come with the software. It gives you instructions on how to register and download all the software you need from their site for free. That way, they aren't shipping any outdated software with the product."
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,Do you have to have a mac to use this product?,no you can use it with a windows computer also.
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,does this item come with its own sounds or do i have to use it as a controller,Internally?  No.  It is simply a USB controller.  It does come with software that you can install on a Mac/PC that will allow you to have a variety of sounds. But none on board.
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,does this item come with its own sounds or do i have to use it as a controller,"Yes, it comes quite a large selection of sounds (software not built in to the device) So, It is a controller. Could be used with a lot of  software Synths."
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,does this item come with its own sounds or do i have to use it as a controller,no onboard sounds but offers extensive sound banks thru software program (included)
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,does this item come with its own sounds or do i have to use it as a controller,"This is a midi controller which means it does not have built in sounds, but it does come with software called Analog Lab which has over 5,000 sounds in it, you use this controller with a computer via USB to control the sounds in Analog Lab or other programs that use a midi controller."

Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,does this work with logic pro x,"yes, it supports VST, RTAS and Audio Unit standards as well as stand alone. Logic and Main Stage support both VST and AU. This instrument will also work with Cubase, Digital Performer,  Pro Tools and Ableton among others."
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,Can you assign specific sounds (let's say a scream) to the keys and pads on the midi controller or only the sounds that come with MiniLab?,"Yes, you can easily assign other sounds"
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,Can you assign specific sounds (let's say a scream) to the keys and pads on the midi controller or only the sounds that come with MiniLab?,"Paul, If you are asking if a raw sound file (like .wav) can be directly triggered from the pads, the answer is no.  The pads can send out midi commands - so if you had the Minilab controlling some software that has, say a scream or an explosion or various sounds associated with notes on a keyboard, you could program the pads to trigger these.  Hope this helps."
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,Are the pads velocity sensitive?,"Yes they are, as the keys. Also, hit' em to hard and forget about that pad."
Musical_Instruments,B00COPKOUK,Does the Pitch control have a way to return to 0 like the more common spring-loaded pitch wheels do?,"Yes, it works exactly the same as regular jog wheel. Thanks Tony."
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IIJY,Are there enough outputs for a 4 channel dj mixer?,"No, there are 2 stereo outs. Because stereo = 2 channels (left and right) it is listed as 4 channel output. You need 8 channel output so that you would have 4 stereo channels. There are very few audio interfaces that support 4 stereo outputs. You need something like a Native Instruments Traktor Scratch A10."
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IIJY,It is bus powered?,"No. You must use the included power supply as bus power doesn't provide enough power. Starting with the 6i6 and above, power supplies are required. The 2i4 and below will run on bus power."
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IIJY,It is bus powered?,No it is not bus powered.  You will have to use the power supply.
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IIJY,It is bus powered?,No.  2 and 4 are but not 6

Musical_Instruments,B00CXZ0VMC,Is this a better package rather than buying Image-Line Software Image Line FL Studio Producer Edition 11 (with multiple machine installations)?,Depends on how useful you think the extra plug-ins would be. If you purchased those plug-ins separately it would cost you over $600. If you don't have a software sampler or SoundFont player it's not a bad move up.

Musical_Instruments,B00CXZ0VMC,Does it come with the license or key?,"Yes, it comes with a license"
Musical_Instruments,B00CXZ0VMC,Does it come with the license or key?,"Yes, you get 1 license key with the purchase."

Musical_Instruments,B00CXZ0VMC,what is the difference between the FL Studio 11 Signature Bundle Academic and the one which is not academic?,"There are several high dollar plug-ins that are included for students.

Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,"Do the cymbals have choke and the pads are dual zone, like the dm7x 6 piece?","Yes, the choke on the crash with the session kit as well as the snare are dual zone. The toms however are not dual-zone.Just to be clear, 'dual-zone' in this case means a rim zone and a center head zone. You can also tweak the hi-hat 'splash sensitivity'."
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,Does this kit have the issue of the hi-hat triggering a rimshot like the DM6 does?,it's such a huge problem it makes the system unusable.
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,Does this kit have the issue of the hi-hat triggering a rimshot like the DM6 does?,"Yes, it happens sometimes but not often."

Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,Picture shows a base pedal.  Does it con=me with the kit?,Yes. it comes with a pedal. Its a stealth pedal n it connects to the stealth kick. its weird at first but you will get use to it. The kick shorted out after a month so i had to return it.
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,The picture doesnt show the kick pad. is the bass kick mallet the only thing included? when you play it simply swings in air?,the mallet swings in a downward position and strikes a small rubber pad on the unit.. everything is included..
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,The picture doesnt show the kick pad. is the bass kick mallet the only thing included? when you play it simply swings in air?,"It doesn't have the standard vertical kick pad. This kit uses a new inverted pad that is on the floor The mallet has a bend in it that when it swings, it swings downwards to hit the pad. They use this new design to help stop the kick pad from sliding and moving when it is played.However, it does feel different and can become rather annoying. It took a little adjusting in the way i play and i had to adjust the pedal to be able to bounce the way i like because it was very stiff at first. But no, you're not just swinging at air. Lol."
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,The picture doesnt show the kick pad. is the bass kick mallet the only thing included? when you play it simply swings in air?,It's a new design.  The mallet actually hits a stopper and produces the bass note.  The picture does not show the thin cables that run between all the various parts to the center controller.
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,The picture doesnt show the kick pad. is the bass kick mallet the only thing included? when you play it simply swings in air?,"No, it's a bass kick pad, that connects to the controller. The mallet hits an electronic pad and gives you your bass drum sound."

Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,An honest opinion of the product from someone who has owned the kit for a while?,"Great kit, satisfied with all the features."
Musical_Instruments,B00F3W27GA,An honest opinion of the product from someone who has owned the kit for a while?,"i bought this set to record with and have had it for about 8 months.  it plays and responds like a real kit all except when you play with an open hihat.  the factory sounds are a little dated but the parameters are easy to adjust to dial in the sounds you like.  This set is fantastic for live performance and is easy to transport.  the bass drum pedal tends to walk away but if you attached it to a board and put your throne on it, it would be perfect.  It only walks away because there is no bass drum to hold it in place.  good set.  good value."

Musical_Instruments,B0002F7ENY,"Would this support a 16"" crash, or would that be too heavy?","Actually, that arm is going to support even a 20, or 22 inch crash ride cymbal. It's elbow has teeth that interlock when tightened. The arm is solid metal, and also has no-slip grip texturing all along it, so that when it's knob is tightened, it's not going to twist under the load of a heavy cymbal. The only thing you'll need to worry about is that the stand it's going to be attached to will support the mass of both, the arm, and cymbal, together. It'll get the job done, nicely."

Musical_Instruments,B0002GJTH2,i take it these cant be hooked up with a pioneer vsx 51 receiver?,"You just need a speaker cable that converts from whatever the pioneer uses to a speakon plug or a phono plug. Amazon probably carries that cable. The Pioneed should have enough power to run these - they are 8 ohm speakers.Just search for ""banana plug to speakon"" for one possibilityAlso there is a newer series of jrx speakers - you should probably get those instead."
Musical_Instruments,B0002GJTH2,i take it these cant be hooked up with a pioneer vsx 51 receiver?,perhaps not. This is a pro audio speaker that should be matched to amps in the 250-400 watt range. Yours is only 80.

Musical_Instruments,B0002GJTH2,is this the price for pair?,no they are well worth if you play in a band
Musical_Instruments,B0002GJTH2,is this the price for pair?,"You will want an amp....receivers tend to be weak for speakers like these.....In theory you could hook them up using a 1/4 inch by 3.5mm audio connection running off the headphone jack on an mp3 player and they will play....They won't sound good, distorted and weak but they work there.....You will want an amp though....Otherwise you are better off hooking up some computer speakers to your audio source. If it's in your range....go with QSC GX3 you can't go wrong....and it's tough just like these speakers. You will want power to get the most out of them."

Source: http://tascam.com/product/dr-100mkii/specifications/If you look at the images, this recorder has two XLR inputs on the bottom of the unit, and it also offers Phantom Power (which this version of the SM93 requires).

Musical_Instruments,B0002MSKWG,how does it work without the cartridges and do the cartridges have actual songs on them,"Forget the cartridges: if you want to play a song AT YOUR OWN PACE, with pauses for effect, select 'EZ Play' and use the Q-chord like a guitar, selecting the right chord buttons (usually in a close cluster, eg G-D-A7) and strum on the strum-plate with one or more fingers.

Musical_Instruments,B0002MSKWG,"Can you play individual or combinations of strings, and, can you bend notes/chords?","Each chord button (or chord combo) causes the strum plate to have 3 notes of that chord repeated across four octaves. You can play each note individually or strum (or a combination) by lightly running your fingers along the strumplate. There's also something called the ""Pitch Bend"" (it's that silver knob on the outer edge of the Q) that lets you bend the sounds coming from the strum plate. Here's a picture to better illustrate: http://qchord.net/docs/features_map.htm ."

Better sound?","You'll find whole discussion threads on banjo groups as to whether or not more brackets makes for more even tension on the banjo head, but the general consensus is that it really doesn't make that much difference so long as you have a certain minimal number (somewhere around 18) and they're properly placed.  In fact, professional bluegrass banjos (such as the Gibson Mastertone) typically have 24 brackets, whereas cheaper entry-level aluminum-pot banjos are more likely to have 30.What matters to the sound is how evenly the brackets are tightened, not how many of them there are."

The spacing on this guitar is pretty much standard run of the mill spacing, not especially close, but not as wide as say, a classic nylon guitar.  But all you have to do is look at someone like Roy Clark who did pretty well on a standard Gibson neck with his fat fingers.  Just gotta try it and see.  Just be sure and check the return policy before you put any money down."

Musical_Instruments,B000KUENNU,Can you connect this direct to pc? What cable please.,Connecting this to pc is an activity.  The microphone uses xlr professional connector.  Using various adapters to change interface results in signal leakage and hum is picked up.  Thus equipment will work with professional audio equipment and not very well with a pc.  Very difficult to use because minimizing hum pick up is a major activity.
Musical_Instruments,B000KUENNU,Can you connect this direct to pc? What cable please.,"No, you need a adc interface this is an analog only unit"

Musical_Instruments,B001R2NR3C,never played one but have heard its got a great history...can it cover AC/DC and 80s Metal as well as some British Blues?,"That's what it does best, as far as the gain channel goes. The range that it covers without much tweaking is between the Clapton style overdrive and say, Judas Priest style 80's metal. More subtle than that and you'll need a boost in front of the clean channel (which it actually handles well). If you want something more brutal, stick a pedal in front. Just remember that it's a 1x12 combo and not a thiele cab."

The TransTube series (which this is a part of) dates back to 1995, so that is when the technology behind this amp was first used.  Y2PLAY (and probably most other authorized Peavey Dealers) would have 'new stock' on the amps, which typically means that they have been manufactured in the last year or two, at most three.  In other words, the actual amp you would buy would not be old."

The cushions can be taken off and put on again to be replaced or repositioned."

You need to push the flat button however many times and then tune.  It also does not show any notes other than EADGBe.

Musical_Instruments,B002I7TJNW,"This records 8 tracks simultaneously, fine. But does it permit recording to a single track at a time?","yes, furthermore that track may be mono or stereo.better still .. a track, or tracks may be recorded while others play back, and you can mix down all your tracks to a single track to reopen all your channels for more tracks ... its as mild or wild as you need it to be"
Musical_Instruments,B002I7TJNW,"This records 8 tracks simultaneously, fine. But does it permit recording to a single track at a time?","Yes, you can record to a single track, or any number of tracks up to and including 8 tracks, at a time. What you cannot do is to route an input to another track, i.e., you cannot plug your guitar, say, into the input for track 1 and route the signal so that it records on another track. However, once the track has been recorded, you can assign the recorded track to another track, thereby freeing up - in this example - input 1. This can be important because there is only one 'Hi-Z' input, which is actually input 1."
Musical_Instruments,B002I7TJNW,"This records 8 tracks simultaneously, fine. But does it permit recording to a single track at a time?","Yes. You can record on one individual track at a time, or two, or three, or up to eight simultaneously.  As an example you could record a drum track on track one, and then go back and record a guitar track over top of that on track two. This is the general idea of multi track recording."
Musical_Instruments,B002I7TJNW,"This records 8 tracks simultaneously, fine. But does it permit recording to a single track at a time?","Peter, you can record from a single track up to eight tracks, but you have the option to connect another Zoom R16 and add another 8 tracks so you can have up to 16 tracks.I recommend to watch video lessons in the internet, specially the David Wills lessons in ProAudio DVDsGod Bless!"

Musical_Instruments,B003V4BFYC,Size? Is it heavy? Need to take on plane in carry-on luggage.,"It's too long for carry on, but packaged fairly well, it might do ok in check luggage, the box will get damaged, but contents should survive..."
Musical_Instruments,B003V4BFYC,Size? Is it heavy? Need to take on plane in carry-on luggage.,Not heavy.  Probably could get in large - extra large duffle bag.
Musical_Instruments,B003V4BFYC,Size? Is it heavy? Need to take on plane in carry-on luggage.,"This item is huge. It measures 3' x 14"" x 6"" approximately. It is not heavy when removed from the box, but the length and width would make it cumbersome to travel with. Hope this helps."
Musical_Instruments,B003V4BFYC,Size? Is it heavy? Need to take on plane in carry-on luggage.,It's very light but you would need a case to put it in to carry it on the plane. It's about 38 inches long.
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,"The DC power supply included with this, is it 100-240v ie can it be used worldwide? Does the stomp get hot during usage like a normal tube amp does?",It doesn't get hot only a little warm after 3 or 4 constant hours but haven't used it on any power greater than 120 volt!
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,Can this be powered with OneSpot using an adaptor like the IsoPump?,"No, you'll want to use the EHX adapter which is 24 volt/3 amps - it's a hunger lil' feller.From EHX's website: ""The 44 MAGNUM requires a power supply capable of delivering at least 2A (more available current is better) at exactly 24 VDC."""
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,"hi, this comes with dc adapter?",Yep-comes with power pack type. Highly recommend! Just make sure speakers are 8ohms..
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,No it should only be plugged into a speaker not another amp.   It is an amazing piece of equipment though.  The volume it can produce will amaze you. Just place it last in the signal chain and have it run straight to your speaker.
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,No... It is a 44 watt power amp. Plugging this into the front end of an amp will cause severe damage!
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,No. This IS the amp.
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,No. It is designed to drive speakers only! If you try what you are suggesting you will blow your amp.
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,"you will blow up your amp if u plug it into the input channel. this unit is already an amp itself, its meant to be plugged into a speaker cabinet."
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,"You do hook it up like you would a stomp box, but you don't turn it on and off. It's your power amp, so it should be at the end of any chain of stomp boxes, otherwise you could fry your stomp boxes. This would be between any effects and your cabinet. You could go straight from your guitar, into this, and then to the cabinet, but you'd then have no way to shape your sound. Just think of this as a plain power amp, nothing else."
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,"The 44 Magnum should be plugged into a non-powered speaker cabinet. You can plug your guitar directly into the input of the pedal, but the output is upwards of 44 watts and could damage a standard amplifier. The pedal is made to replace the need for a powered amplifier head or combo amp."
Musical_Instruments,B003VCCUKM,can this work as a stomp box where you plug your guitar up to it and plug that it your amp?,"No. It is a power amp. You can only plug the 44 into a speaker. Plugging into your amp will break the 44, your amp or both."

Musical_Instruments,B003Z9W3IK,Does It have a headphone jack,"The guitar plugs into the amp, which has a headphone jack. But you'll probably need to buy an adapter for your headphones because the headphone port on the amp is the same size as the one for the guitar. However, plugging in your headphones straight into the guitar doesn't work, it has to go through the amp."
Musical_Instruments,B003Z9W3IK,Does It have a headphone jack,Yes it does on the amplifier. And there's also a jack for cd/tape too
Musical_Instruments,B003Z9W3IK,will it be small for a 6 foot guy?,Honestly don't think so.  Sized like a Stratocaster.

Musical_Instruments,B003Z9W3IK,does it come with tuner,No not an electric one.
Musical_Instruments,B003Z9W3IK,does it come with tuner,It does but not a snark electic one it's worth the extra money to get the electric tuner

Musical_Instruments,B0041206UW,Good with turntables and scratching?,"Not the best fader in the world but for the price its well worth it.

Musical_Instruments,B0045EP4WG,"What are the height, width, and depth of the unit itself?","With the mounting hardware attached it's 23"" x 4"" x 2.5"" but the 2.5"" is really 5"" because the power and DMX plug into the top of the unit and those plugs stick out of the unit an additional 2.5 """
Musical_Instruments,B0045EP4WG,how many of these would be good for a four panel scrim ?,"for best results you would need one Am. DJ Supply Mega Bar for each panel.  This would not allow cross lighting for the back panels.  To add xlighting effect, you would need to add one at a minimum of one additional."
Musical_Instruments,B0045EP4WG,Are these bright enough to show solid color on a white wall with three 60-watt bulbs on or would the LEDs get washed out?,"It would depend on how close the 60-watt bulbs were to where the Mega Bar was casting its light and how much area it was casting to, but would say that it would be washed out, and not very dramatic as where there was little light. The light is focused but not really all that bright."
Musical_Instruments,B0045EP4WG,Does this product have a battery or does it need to be plugged in to a power source in order to function?,Needs to be plugged in
Musical_Instruments,B0045EP4WG,Does this product have a battery or does it need to be plugged in to a power source in order to function?,Needs to be plugged into a power supply.  You are also able to daisy chain the power but you need to buy an additional cord for that.

But in the end it really depends on what your requirements are."
Musical_Instruments,B00476B908,"Is there a way to run these off of battery power, like AA's? And if so, can you recommend parts?","You should be able to use batteries since these only work with dc voltage which is the type of current batteries have. You will need a lot of double AAs since you need 36 watts and that would probably not last long anyway. If you need to use batteries, your best bet would be a car battery, it is 12 Volts and will last you much much longer and you can recharge it."
Musical_Instruments,B00476B908,Are these individually addressable?,No not unless you get different power boxes and solder your own connects its one long strip that is all controlled by one power box

It does sound better than a computer sound card, since it doesn't compress the sound and you get non-buzzing and hum less sound."
Musical_Instruments,B004A4PSEU,"If you're using mono, does it only use one output (only r or l)?  or are both outputs giving the same signal out?",It would depend on your computer settings.

Musical_Instruments,B004A4PSEU,"If you're using mono, does it only use one output (only r or l)?  or are both outputs giving the same signal out?",Both outputs are given the same signal
Musical_Instruments,B004A4PSEU,"On a Mac, does the system volume control still work, or is it pegged at line level? e.g. can you use the volume in the menu bar or keyboard volume?",System volume will still work. Best regards

Musical_Instruments,B004EKMR30,Will the Traktor Kontrol S2 fit properly in this case?,"To put it simply, no it will not"
Musical_Instruments,B004EKMR30,Will the Traktor Kontrol S2 fit properly in this case?,"It would not fit the Kontrol S2 without modifying the internal foam, quite a bit. The Kontrol S2 is a lot less wide, so it would end up with huge gaps on either side."
Musical_Instruments,B004EKMR30,"What are the inside dimensions of the box? Assuming there is room to be used for cables and such, does anyone mind measuring? Thanks a lot!",Haven't measured but there isnt really that much space for extra cables or accessories.

Musical_Instruments,B004QL0D74,"Can these be hard wired? There isn't an open outlet where these will be going, but there is existing under lighting they will be replacing.","Theoretically yes they can... think of just taking the plug and removing it to expose the wires... then you have to connect them, etc to your exposed line.  Either a electrician or a fairly competent technically minded person can do this. The transformer has to be used though (small brick)... so don't cut the wire before the brick.  ;-)"

Just make sure you clamp it someplace that will not interfere with the vibrations you are looking to amplify."

Musical_Instruments,B004VQDAQK,would these be good for an arena (indoor or outdoor),"It's pretty loud for the size, but a space you could describe as an ""arena"" might require something more substantial.

Musical_Instruments,B0052QOTFE,would this be a good mixing board for a podcast/internet radio?,"It would probably be overkill for a podcast, unless you're hosting a 5-piece band as part of your show.  This mixer is really for full-band live performance.  If you're looking for something to mix voice and some other sounds your best bet would be something with many fewer channels."
Musical_Instruments,B0052QOTFE,would this be a good mixing board for a podcast/internet radio?,"It really is a shame that Mackie sells a Chinese product of such poor quality.-I'm loving the Mackie brand (but made ​​in USA) the big brands should not mutate to China .-To purchase expensive merchandise famous brand but made ​​in China, is the same buying any brand equipment without brand.-"

Find a good purpose-built nylon string guitar, such as the Yamaha NTX700 instead."
Musical_Instruments,B0057GPM5A,Can nylon string be put on this guitar?,No Nylon should not be put on this guitar
Musical_Instruments,B0057GPM5A,Can nylon string be put on this guitar?,"No, nylon strings will not work on this guitar. The nut slots are cut for steel strings and the guitar is designed and braced for steel strings. While you could install nylon strings, they would not vibrate the top sufficiently to sound good. If you want a nylon string guitar there are plenty of inexpensive classical guitars available. Those will be designed to sound good with nylon strings."

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,can this be mounted on a standard mic stand with out a boom?,"Hello.  Yes.  The boom is a good way to get the mic overhead and away from the base (and ultimately upside down when you're using it).  But on a regular mic stand, without a boom, the mount goes directly on the threads where the microphone clip would normally go.  The Blue Radius mount has a swivel and adjuster that is included with it.  So you can mount it on a vertical mic stand and adjust the mount to be horizontal.  Then the mic can be used right-side-up...  or down if you prefer.  Lol.  The short answer, however, is YES.  No problem."
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,can this be mounted on a standard mic stand with out a boom?,Yes it can... Just remember this will the point out at a 90 degree angle... not sure it would be very usable. If that is what you want to do then just mount the microphone directly to the stand. Then the microphone is straight up in the air.
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,whats the difference between this on and the 1st one?,The difference between the Radius and the Radius II is that they made a better screw that tightens and holds it at the desired angle. Apparently on the original Radius this would break or not hold it properly.
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,whats the difference between this on and the 1st one?,Blue has 2 shock mount styles... This one is specifically for the Yeti and YetiPro... The first one  is for all other Blue Microphone styles.
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,"His this been redesigned yet, if not, whats another shockmount for the Yeti?",There is a custom Spider Shock mount that is available on Amazon that supports the Yeti and Yeti Pro. Costs less and is much better quality.
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,what size is the thread where it attaches to a boom?,"5/8 x 27 thread per in. Standard mic stand threads, you can use a reducer if you need to get it down to 3/8"

Musical_Instruments,B005EHINAS,this amp will cover a hall with about 300 people or i need to get the nu6000,You did not mention what you need it for and what speakers you have. For amplifying voice it is more than enough power.  If you're a dj and are planning to play music you will need a second nu 3000 connected to a subwoofer. If you have 8 ohm speakers you get sbout 200 watts per channel.  For more power you can connect two speakers on each channel making an impedance of 4 ohms.

Musical_Instruments,B005EHINAS,880w 4oms what would it be for 8oms?,440 per Pg 19 of the manual
Musical_Instruments,B005EHINAS,880w 4oms what would it be for 8oms?,"if you are asking if it would be 880w at 8 ohms the answer would be no ,the higher the load the lower the wattage"
Musical_Instruments,B005EHINAS,880w 4oms what would it be for 8oms?,It would be half of that approximately.
Musical_Instruments,B005EHINAS,880w 4oms what would it be for 8oms?,At 8 ohms the watts decrease by half or 440 watts.
Musical_Instruments,B005EHINAS,880w 4oms what would it be for 8oms?,"Well, typically when you double the resistance (ohms) you half the watts output. So, that would indicate that the amp outputs 440watts into 8 ohms stereo."

Musical_Instruments,B006MNGBR0,Does this product work on the 120volt side and will it work with led puck lights,"This product used 120V AC power and converts it to 12V DC power.  It will work for any type of 12V DC device.  Beware though, polarity is important in DC devices.  If it doesn't turn on at first, reverse the wires and it should work.  Also, these transformers have a maximum load in watts.  Be sure to know the watts of your string of devices.  Do not overload the transformer.  If you need to, buy two.  That is the downside of using a lot of LED lighting devices.  They may be cheap but the transformers and additional wiring can be expensive.  Hope this helped."

Got it?  Peter"

Musical_Instruments,B00B41JIY8,Will this mic rotate so it can be used to provide HD sound over a video recording?,"Does not rotate and is fixed in position by the 30 way connector on iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. But you can rotate the Apple device that you are using for the recording so that mic channels are vertical or horizontal etc. Rode were supposed to be bringing out a hot-shoe clamp to hold iXY mic attached to iPhone or iPod Touch. You can also take analog output from the iPhone jack socket and record direct onto the camera."

Musical_Instruments,B00B41JIY8,Does the included App allow for voice-regocnition / convert to text?  If not - what is the best App for this?,Neither of the Rode Apps do voice recognition or convert to text. The sound quality from this mic is probably overkill for your application. If mono sound is OK use a Rode SmartLav mic or similar on the headphone jack and look for an iphone app that does what you want.
Musical_Instruments,B00B41JIY8,Does the app allow for multi-tracking?,"No, the Rode app only caters for L&R; from either the Rode iXY or the iOS device internal mic. But you can export .wav or .mp3 recordings to Audacity and manipulate them there."
Musical_Instruments,B00B41JIY8,Does the app allow for multi-tracking?,"Yes. You can select Merge (as opposed to overwrite or append) as a recording option - which is effectively overdubbing the original stereo (2-ch) recording with another. Makes it destructive though, in that sense. HTH"
Musical_Instruments,B00B41JIY8,"What's the frequency response for this mic? The description mentions 24-bit/96kHz recording, implying a frequency response of around 48kHz.",Frequency response implies a lower and upper frequency and signal amplitude variation measured in decibels. For the RODE iXY that is 20Hz to 20KHz +/- 3dB in other words pretty flat. 48KHz is the maximum frequency that can be digitised by a 96KHz sampling frequency (the Nyquist criterion). You can access further details on the microphone by Googling RODE iXY Specs.

Musical_Instruments,B00B5OY8BW,is this amp good for metal/punkrock,"Yes, utilizing the power sponge knob (all the way up) and finding a setting with decent distortion will create a heavy sound that the metal/punk genre is known for.

Musical_Instruments,B00B5SDFRG,How well does this device interface with the PC? Can you use standard .wav ACID files on the device?,"You'll need to download a driver from the Korg website first, but yes it can."
Musical_Instruments,B00B5SDFRG,What is best way to connect guitar? Direct to microphone jack? OK to connect it via effects pedal first? What about keyboards etc? Thanks!,you could connect anything you want to it via RCA input on the back side of it as long as you monitor the signal going in so it doesn't overload. the peak indicator will light up red if the signal is peaking. just get the converter for the type of cable you are using and everything should work just fine. i would not suggest using microphone jack to connect anything but the microphone to it. hope this helps you. cheers

Musical_Instruments,B00C10964I,do you need this pedal to control all of the vypyr 20 functions or can they be controlled strait from the amp itself?,"You can access all effects and amp modeling but of course having a footswitch to change patches is a great value. One thing you can't do from the amp is access the looper. This looper is a great effect to use, just try it a while to get used to how it works and you can layer tracks in no time. Download the manual and you can learn more all about it."
Musical_Instruments,B00C10964I,do you need this pedal to control all of the vypyr 20 functions or can they be controlled strait from the amp itself?,Not required - just easier to switch to memory locations; foot pedal functions as both volume and wah-wah.

Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,PAIR OF MONITORS OR IS ONLY ONE ???,"Only one monitor comes with each purchase, so make sure to order two if you want a pair."
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,What specific cables and adapters would i need to connect this to a usb output? are any included? if not could you suggest good products?,"If your getting 2 speakers and willing to come out of your  standard 1/8"" audio output of your computer you could get stereo XLR to 1/8"" adapter and/or even just only use one connector. Hosa CYX-403M Stereo Breakout Cable, 3.5 mm TRS to Dual XLR3M - 3 m / 9.8 ft.Other wise your putting out money for thisNady UIC-81XX USB Interface Cables - Two XLR In/OutYour choice"
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,"when you buy a pair, you will need two power outlets to power both right?  and then how do you connect a pair to a laptop w/out an interface?","Yes, each monitor requires 120VAC, so two plugs. Then, each monitor has 3 inputs. XLR balance, TRS balanced, and an unbalanced 'RCA'. RCA is the typical I/O on stereo equipment. So, the simplest way to hook up to a laptop is to acquire a cord with the 1/8' stereo plug on one end (laptop) and two 'RCA' plugs (left & right) on the other. There are DAC's (i.e.. MusicStreamer II+) which will convert a higher quality signal from your laptop using the USB port and output that signal via 'RCA' ... hope this helps"
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,"when you buy a pair, you will need two power outlets to power both right?  and then how do you connect a pair to a laptop w/out an interface?","You can get an adapter cable that plugs into the headphone jack of your laptop with stereo RCA plugs on the other end.  But the digital - to analogue converters built into most laptops are not very good, so for better sound you may want to invest in a separate d/a converter."
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,"when you buy a pair, you will need two power outlets to power both right?  and then how do you connect a pair to a laptop w/out an interface?",You need a power cord for each Eris E5 80 -Watt. They are sold seperatly so to use the xlr or quarter inch input you would require an interface. They have an RCA jack which you can use a RCA to Aux cable but the feed will not be balanced and you will have a great amount of white noise above the -3 DB range.
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,"when you buy a pair, you will need two power outlets to power both right?  and then how do you connect a pair to a laptop w/out an interface?",Yes. You'll need an auxiliary jack.

Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,Is  this monitor compatible with the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2?,"Yes, it is, the only thing is that they would have unbalanced outputs, but that is good. Also if you want them to have them balanced, you may buy a Mixer which main outputs are balanced with a pair of cables XLR so that you may use the balanced inputs on your monitors."
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,"Although it states ""Monitor"" it also states ""â¢2-way active studio monitors"" in the description pls make it clear it is only ONE!","Do you mean one monitor? They are sold as single monitor (each) unless it says sold in pair. If you're referring to a two way speaker system, there is a two way speaker there is a tweeter and a sub. There's definitely a crossover. The sound fantastic. There is no deep bass by design, however, the volume and the clarity of what is really in the mix is very good"
Musical_Instruments,B00CP4IJH0,"Although it states ""Monitor"" it also states ""â¢2-way active studio monitors"" in the description pls make it clear it is only ONE!","Yes, they are sold singley."
Musical_Instruments,B00D69U1B0,Does this work with Raspberry Pi?,"Raspberry pi A has a 2.0 usb port & the b model sports 2,  as long as there is an internal sound module this device will replace the headphone & mike jacks on your units, To iterate, you must have the internal audio module in your master unit.

Musical_Instruments,B00DVVPDNO,Can 2 mics be connected and heard simultaneously?,Nope. And then the charger stopped charging and the sound quality sucks. Not worth $100.

JPit has video card inside the machine."
Musical_Instruments,B00E3V2JV0,Can the pulmonica be cleaned or sanitized?,"Yes, please go to the Pulmonica website to for more detailed instructions, but the short answer is to gently swish it around in a bowl of water or diluted (non-sugared) mouthwash and then again in a bowl of clean water. Do not 'slap' it dry, but set it up on the black edge saying Pulmonica (down) so that the mouth piece edge is up. Let it dry."
Musical_Instruments,B00E3V2JV0,Can the pulmonica be cleaned or sanitized?,"The Pulmonica can also be cold sterilized according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's guidelines, which include submerging in 70% isopropyl alcohol for five minutes and letting the device thoroughly air dry. Because the Pulmonica should not be disassembled for cleaning, soaking for somewhat longer might seem appropriate and would not harm the Pulmonica."
Musical_Instruments,B00E3V2JV0,Can the pulmonica be cleaned or sanitized?,"The Pulmonica can be sanitized by being fully submerged in 70%-95% isopropyl alcohol, 75%-95% ethyl alcohol, or 3% hydrogen peroxide for an appropriate length of time, rinsed in a bowl of sterile water, and let air dry for several hours."

Most of the principles of cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation are the same and emphasize deep breathing such as the Pulmonica encourages."
Musical_Instruments,B00E71EG0I,Can one use three microphones in the front and use fourth one in the back at the same time?,Yes you can.....the three microphones in the front have separate volume control but the back input is straight through.
Musical_Instruments,B00E71EG0I,Can one use three microphones in the front and use fourth one in the back at the same time?,Yes you definitely can. The one plugged into the back will only be adjusted by the main volume knob and the other three have their own individual volume knobs. EQ works for all inputs (front and back). You have to adjust the back mic volume first (main knob) and then layering over top the front mic volumes.
Musical_Instruments,B00E71EG0I,"Is there a way to mount this on a wall?   Also, do you need any additional purchase to mount on a mic stand?","There are no provisions to mount this on the wall, besides, you will occassionally need access to the rear anyways. Also - you dont need to purchase anything additional to mount it on a mircrophone stand, as it already comes with an adaptor just for that purpose. If you are handy enough, you could mount it on the wall using the bottom center hole that's supposed to be used for the mircophone stand, so it would work like a swivel mount. You would have to fabricate this type of mount yourself."
Musical_Instruments,B00E71EG0I,Does it have a rechargeable battery built in?,"NO, it needs to be plugged it all times"
Musical_Instruments,B00E71EG0I,Does it have a rechargeable battery built in?,"No battery, it comes with a standard computer-style (IEC320C13) power cord."

Musical_Instruments,B00EDUGBB0,Is the mega flat pak the same as the mega par profile or are they 2 different models ?,They're the same thing. This is a way better deal if you're looking to get more than one. Recommend buying the daisy chain IEC cables as well since this doesn't come with them.
Musical_Instruments,B00EDUGBB0,Is the mega flat pak the same as the mega par profile or are they 2 different models ?,"They are the same thing. It is that it has 4 of them, a bag for them, dmx cables, and safety cables."

Musical_Instruments,B0002D05KA,"What do ya'll recommend for mounting theses? Looking for something simple and clean, don't want any makes when removed.","Simplest and cleanest - just use picture hangers - large one - the kind with the round metal piece that goes against the sheet rock, and the 45 degree angle pin sticking out of it - put two in the wall and just hang the foam on them. No mess no fuss change your mind just put a little dab of paint on the hole."

After a few minutes the bond will be permanent."

It seems that it's an 12AU7 vs a 12AX7, but maybe that does not matter.","All ""12"" series tube pins are identical. A 12ax7 has a higher output than a 12au7 (which has the lowest of the series) and may cause distortion or some other unforeseen issue with the circuitry. Before proceeding, you need to know why the manufacturer chose to use a 12au7 and its application in this amplifier. A great rule to follow is don't re-invent the wheel - if the manufacturer designed a circuit to use a particular tube, there's a reason why."

Sound systems work by taking a source, say the sound from your computer, then amplifying it, and playing it.

This allows the the speaker to be much more portable, while sacrificing some power (not much, though) All you have to do to get this speaker to work is plug a source directly into the speaker, plug the speaker into a power source, and hit play."

Musical_Instruments,B0036E8DE2,How does this get to 18 inputs?,"As Mark already mentioned, it is a bit of creative counting.  1 - 6 are mono inputs.  The next 4 inputs are 'double' and can take individual input signals but the pairs share a single level control.  To individually control them, you'd need to use both hands and PAN while you slide the main level for the pair of channels.  Then similarly, the two Aux 1 & 2 are stereo too and similarly do not have separate controls  and are therefore only marginally useful as individual distinct inputs."

Compare your width and a fellow student's who plays the violin (the bridges, that is); if they're approximately the same, it will work.  Depth does not matter.  The mute is a good product for its purpose.  If used often, it should remain flexible and useful for a lifetime."
Musical_Instruments,B0002II6V0,How is this placed on the violin?,You simply place the mute on the bridge of the violin and it silences the strings.
Musical_Instruments,B0002II6V0,How is this placed on the violin?,There is a slot lengthwise along the middle. That slides over the bridge.

Musical_Instruments,B0002II6V0,How does it work?,"Notice that there are four slots for the strings and one for the bridge.  Align the slot for the bridge with the bridge and gently press the mute down with the strings between the accompanying slots.  When the device is in place, play normally.  You will hear the string tones, but persons ten feet or more away will not be distracted by the tones, good, bad or indifferent.  Try it; you'll like it!  It will not work for the brainless."

Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,What cable do you need to plug in into a guitar amp?,"Use an XLR into mic with 1/4"" plug going into guitar amp. If you have an XLR into into your amp, you use can useXLR to XLR (which will give you a hotter ""louder"" output)."
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,What cable do you need to plug in into a guitar amp?,"As the other person said, you would probably need a female XLR to male 1/4"" cable. Something like this: Pyle-Pro PPMJL15 Professional Microphone Cable 1/4'' Male to XLR Female - 15 FeetBut check to see if your amp has an XLR (3-prong) input. If it does, a typical mic cable (XLR to XLR) would do."
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,What cable do you need to plug in into a guitar amp?,"It depends on what you are trying to do.  Regardless of the physical connections, a guitar amp will not sound good as a vocal PA.  Also, a microphone level signal is too low for a guitar amp.

Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,"If it has no On/Off or Mute switch, how do you turn it off??? Need to pull out the USB?",Many mics of this type don't have an on/off switch. You're meant to control the mics from the mixer.
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,"If it has no On/Off or Mute switch, how do you turn it off??? Need to pull out the USB?","You are correct,  If you want it off,  You have to either unplug it at the Microphone, orat the other end.  OR you can just turn it way down at your Mixer or Amplifier."
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,"If it has no On/Off or Mute switch, how do you turn it off??? Need to pull out the USB?",This is like most standard XLR microphones in that it does not have an on/off switch.  They are usually utilized by plugging into a mixer so the mixer would control the on/off status. There is no USB connection on this microphone.
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,"If it has no On/Off or Mute switch, how do you turn it off??? Need to pull out the USB?",This is not a USB mic...it has a broadcast standard XLR plug.  As is has no switch you must disconnect it directly.
Musical_Instruments,B0002KZAKS,"If it has no On/Off or Mute switch, how do you turn it off??? Need to pull out the USB?","This is not a USB mic. You can use the PAD button on your amplifier, or lower the volume. Most amplifiers nowadays also have a STANDBY button that mutes all inputs except music from RCA or 1/4 inputs designed for that purpose. You do not want to plug or unplug the mic while connected to the amp while it's on. It'll make loud pop noises, and that's the least of it."

Musical_Instruments,B000CCN152,will this automaticly adjust the frequencies?,"Yes, it will, but you wear an omnidirecional microphone (like ECM 8000) together.It is not so easy to do. There are so many adjusts, menus and options. If you are an advanced user, it should be easier. See the user manual. Best regards!"
Musical_Instruments,B000CCN152,can this operate on 240 volt ? or only 110,"The answer is Yes ! The DEQ2496 has a wide range smps. It says 100 to 240 V 50/60 Hz, 10 Watts near the IEC power socket.

Musical_Instruments,B000FJ1NWA,is alto lower than soprano?,"Yes.  That's the short answer.  The alto's lowest note is the F below the soprano's lowest of C.  HOWEVER, it will be written as if it were a higher note than the soprano.  That's because the soprano actually sounds an octave higher than written and the alto sounds the pitch that is written.Want some fun?  Try the tenor recorder.  Its music is exactly the same as the soprano, but since it doesn't sound an octave higher than written, it produces a warm sound that  blends well with the human voice."
Musical_Instruments,B000FJ1NWA,is alto lower than soprano?,"The lowest note on a soprano is ""C"".  The analogous note (all holes closed) on an alto is the ""F"" below it.  A tenor can play the ""C"" below that and a bass can play the ""F"" below that."

The quality is good for an inexpensive mic, but not on par with a professional vocal performance mic like a Shure SM58.  If you want to use it to record into a USB hub, your connection would probably look like this:  Mic > preAmp > mixer > DA/Converter-USB > PC.  The preAmp is optional but probably a good idea."

Musical_Instruments,B0038W9LJI,"im a dj just starting i just want learn to cut, stratch and blend music what system should  i get","The NS7 is excellent for scratching given the size of the platters AND the real vinyl. If scratching is important to you, you can't beat the NS7. Now, if you are hoping to simply mix music, there are a lot of great options for less money. Vestax makes great controllers, as does Traktor. There are a lot of variables you have to consider when deciding which is right for you. The NS7 is heavy. However, it's heavy because it's sold metal construction. The Ns7 has t channels while the Ns6 and Traktor s4 have four channels.Hope This helps!"

Musical_Instruments,B005BSOVRY,Is this a balanced or unbalanced mic?,"i believe these mics come soldered with pins 1&3 together, which makes it unbalance. To make it a balance signal you will have to unsolder pins 1&3 Which can be done fairly easy."

Musical_Instruments,B005BSOVRY,Is this microphone good for instruments?,"Yes. It is great for  drums, guitars, keyboards, wind instruments (i.e. sax, trumpet, trombone, etc...), and even vocals for some voices. The Pyle Pro PDMIC78 has much the same response as the SHURE SM57 which it is a copy of, however, the Pyle copy is a little brighter sounding in the highs and is a little more sensitive to ""handling noise"" than the Shure but otherwise they sound alike.

If you could find the thinner plastic cards like a hotel room key, then the Pick Punch worked well.   However, if you used a credit card that is generally thicker, then the edge of the pick would come out rough.  You will have to file it with a nail file.  So, it works fine but not great."

Musical_Instruments,B00004UE2D,Is this a left handed guitar?,"No, you have to look for ads saying exactly ""left handed guitar"".

You will need an adaptor or cable that converts XLR to the type of connector on your video camera.  Shouldn't be a problem to find one.  Other than that, its suitability will depend on your use.  If you are using it ""off camera"" and reasonably close to your subject, it should be great.  If you are mounting it on the camera somehow, be aware that it is not a highly directional microphone and you'll be recording most sounds in front of the camera.  Good Luck."

And, how big are they?","These are 4 ohm speakers and they can take a lot of power, 120W continuous, 200W peak output. if your amp isn't rated for 4 ohm speakers you could burn it up trying to drive these.

Musical_Instruments,B0002BBOR0,This mic requires a receiver? How does the camera receive the audio?,You need to conect the mic receiver output to camera input.
Musical_Instruments,B0002BBOR0,Why are so many of the reviews mentioning pastors and churches? Just curious. Is this the kind of mic pastors prefer over any other for any reason?,A lot of churches use this brand because it is made well and available world-wide for a reasonable price. This brandname is gold standard by technical people due to the quality.

Musical_Instruments,B0002CZSPS,Is there a place to store the cleaning rod?,Not really. You could store it in the slide pocket but you'd need to wrap it to keep it separate from your slide.

But a hollow body electric might fit."

Musical_Instruments,B000UJHIS8,"Will this work as an expression pedal with the Line 6 M13? Is a ""volume pedal"" the same thing as an ""expression pedal""?",A volume pedal is usually one that you insert in line with your AUDIO signal to allow volume changes. Those have two jacks so you can put them into the signal path. An Expression pedal usally means that it has a single 1/4 plug on the end which is meant to go into the 'control voltage' jack of a keyboard (as opposed to a sustain pedal plug attached which goes into the jack of the keyboard or controller). That will allow you to control more than just volume depending how your keyboard allows you to assign that jack. But the point is - you need a 'control' input for this pedal.

Musical_Instruments,B000UJHIS8,Is this a continuous control pedal?,"If by your question you mean a MIDI CC pedal, then no. There is only a 1/4"" output of expression pedal type. There is no MIDI output. However, if you hook it up to a keyboard with an expression pedal input, and that keyboard has a MIDI output, you might get MIDI messages out of that corresponding to the pedal position. But that would depend on your keyboard."
Musical_Instruments,B000UJHIS8,Does this item work on the Yamaha DGX-230 and/or YPG-235,"No clue, sorry."
Musical_Instruments,B000UJHIS8,what can this product do?,"Depends on what keyboard it is plugged  into, mostly used for volume"

Don't mix up the vocal settings with the guitar settings, they are separate."

Musical_Instruments,B00B3DXHFS,Can you tune it like a regular guitar?,"Yes...and no.  Yes, it's tuned in ""fourths"" like a guitar, so you play the 5th fret on the lowest string to tune the next higher string just like a guitar.  But, you can't really tune it to E, there's not enough string tension.  So the top and bottom strings are tuned to A.  So it's like playing a regular guitar with a capo at the fifth fret."
Musical_Instruments,B00B3DXHFS,Can you tune it like a regular guitar?,"If you tune it like a regular guitar, e.b. EADGBE, the strings end up being too floppy to play well.  Tune to ADGCEA which is transposed ""up a fourth"" or like a guitar with capo on 5th fret."

No capo is needed to play with a standard Uke tuning.If you play guitar it would be like capoing the 5th fret on the guitar but on the Gretsch 6 string it all 6 open to achieve same.
Musical_Instruments,B00B3DXHFS,"If you're playing a guitalele with someone playing  a uke, tuned with g as top string, where would you capo the ukulele or would that work. cbud","It would not work if the highest pitched string is tuned to G; or rather you'd have to capo WAY up high on the neck as the guitalele is tuned to A.  If the lowest pitched string is tuned to G, then you're fine - no capo required."

It just doesn't add up.
Musical_Instruments,B0002CZV6E,Can the BD-2 also be used with a bass guitar,"Sure- however... Boss guitar pedals have their low end limited from the get go.

This case is for Dreadnaught size guitars. So any brand guitar that is a Dreadnaught size will fit.

But you should still keep in mind that Gemeinhardt's quality has taken a nosedive in recent years, so be prepared to pay for trips to the service shop."
Musical_Instruments,B0002GFQ10,How big is this stand when unfolded? Thanks.,"The rail at the bottom is a little over 17.25"" wide.  The wings at the top are about 22"" wide.

Musical_Instruments,B0002GFQ10,Will it hold a 2 in thick music folder.?,Two inches is probably pushing it. This Hamilton is very stiff to unfold and the bottom does not want to lay completely flat and is therefore a tiny bit wobbly.  The Manhasset table top would probably be better.  Hope this helps.
Musical_Instruments,B0002GFQ10,Will it hold a 2 in thick music folder.?,"yes, it would hold a 2-inch 3-ring notebook or music book.  The bottom is less than 2 inches wide, so a closed book would partly overhang the front edge.  The rear kickstand creates a point of contact on the tabletop along with the rear edge of the base on which the music rests."
Musical_Instruments,B0002GFQ10,How to open music stand?,"Just pull on the outer pieces and it folds out very smoothly to stand on a table. When it's folded up, it is thin and about a foot long."

Musical_Instruments,B0002M3OUO,Is the height of the 2nd tier adjustable?,"No it is not.  Only the angle of the second tier and the overall width is adjustable.  This is a drawback of the design as the height and the depth are not adjustable. You could drill new holes for the mounts to lower the height and you can saw off the  arms to shorten the depth, but that is not a fun task."
Musical_Instruments,B0002M3OUO,Is the second tier good for laptops?,The second tier isn't really that wide. If you put a board or something like that across it maybe you could.

Musical_Instruments,B0002M7MTS,Can these work on 220v?,No. The plug type is american nema 5-15.
Musical_Instruments,B0002M7MTS,Can these work on 220v?,As far as the wiring goes its just a wire connected to a socket. Its a 3 wire grounded plug with two power leads to the socket and ground on the can. You could use an adapter or cut the plug off and install a european plug or what ever. You would of course need 220v bulbs. The 110v bulbs that come with the can would burn out very quickly if not immediately.
Musical_Instruments,B0002M7MTS,"do they have to be mounted, can they be situated on the floor in the corner?","You can place them on the floor they are steady once the brackets are tightened.

Approximately 95db (Subway Train at 200'). Since this is an extremely small amp, the sound quality isn't the greatest. Very similar to a High School P.A. system, but for one room."

Musical_Instruments,B0002OP7VQ,does it come with a cord?,"Nop, just the amp and a battery without even a power cord, and it sound really noisy"

Musical_Instruments,B0002Y6BJI,Should you replace all strings if one breaks?,"If the string failed due to age and normal wear from usage, then replace them all since many times a new string will not match intonation with the old ones.  If , however, it failed due to over tightening or a kink and the set is relatively new, then you may be okay with replacing only the one string."
Musical_Instruments,B0002Y6BJI,Do these strings have a ball end?,yes metal disc like with a hole in the middle.

Musical_Instruments,B0002Z82MQ,These equalizer i use in home o in the car,"Best application is semi-pro or home use. It can be used in a vehicle but you MUST provide a proper power source. In the U.S., that would be 120 Volts AC, 60 Hertz. Inverters are available that could be used for this application. It is also possible to redesign the internal power supply if this is a permanent vehicle installation. This degree of modification is called re-engineering and you have to have quite a bit of expertise in electronics to do it. Also keep in mind this EQ was not designed for the harsh environment of a vehicle..... hot, cold, humidity, vibration, etc."
Musical_Instruments,B0002Z82MQ,These equalizer i use in home o in the car,This is used for Home/Not so Pro Audio setup. But Surely NOT in a Car.

Musical_Instruments,B0002ZPLE8,i live below the kitchen and want to sound proof the wood celing i hear foot steps and things droping will this do the trick?,No it won't. You might put a mic stand on this to isolate it from the hum of a hard drive for instance.

Your Mac also has Gain adjustments in preferences and in MiDi.
Musical_Instruments,B000BBGCCI,what cord do use to go from phono plus to computer,"This is a USB audio interface!

Musical_Instruments,B000CDT4VQ,Will this fit an acoustic guitar?Or a peavy retro fire?,"A peavy retro fire might fit in this case since it is an electric guitar case, so it would not fit an acoustic guitar."

Musical_Instruments,B000CZ0R3S,What is the difference in the SM57 & the other one on amazon  SM57-LC?  Not sure what the LC is about on the other one,"it means less cable (LC)... so your paying for or not for the cable, the mic is the same... whether you want their cable, or another cable, or the cable you already may have is up to you"

Musical_Instruments,B000HVXMNE,"Torn between this and pyle pad20mx that is also a usb mixer. also, how does this compare to other audio interfaces like the m audio counterparts?",Had a bad experience with this...

Musical_Instruments,B000KGW0CK,Can you adjust the tone controls on each channel separately?,"No, it's mono equipment. You can connect something like a MP3 player with a splitter (so you don't miss a channel), and adjust volume separately, but it has one EQ only. It works the same for all channels. In stereo sound, the only thing you'll miss is the panning effect, but besides that, the sound is really good."
Musical_Instruments,B000KGW0CK,Can you adjust the tone controls on each channel separately?,"Yes, but no. You can adjust both volume and fx controls for each channel, but the eq controls are universal. All in all this has been a great purchase. It gets loud and sounds fantastic!"

Musical_Instruments,B000KGW0CK,is this product recommended for singers?,No it is an instrument amp...specifically a keyboard...
Musical_Instruments,B000KGW0CK,is this product recommended for singers?,"No problema at all, works fine. Just consider that has only one canon conector, so you can improve it with an additional mixer with more canon inputs.Also, when using it, don't put it sitting straight on the floor, put it al least 40 cm. high for better performance."
Musical_Instruments,B000KGW0CK,Can you connect this to computer to record what's played by multiple keyboards/instruments?,"Technically yes, but it's not really designed for that.  You would have to take the LINK output and run it to an existing audio interface on your computer.

It's quality enough to do both.No, if you plan on using this for lighting instruments, lighting power, and/or speaker power. It's to thin of a gauge and you'll likely start a fire if you try to put anything of serious power needs through it."
Musical_Instruments,B000RTPBWQ,Is this cable 2 or 3 conductors?,"2 Conductors, plus a shield (ground)."
Musical_Instruments,B000RTPBWQ,Is this cable 2 or 3 conductors?,It's considered two conductor plus shield.

Musical_Instruments,B000SAC5PA,Does it have a neck strap inside to keep the headstock centered (avoid de-tuning),"Yes it does -- but the velcro is miss-matched and will not close tightly enough around the neck to hold it in place. AND, since the neck section is about twice as wide as it needs to be, this is clearly a bad design issue."
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Can this switch be used to start/stop  an electric drum machine,"It depends on the type of switch the drum machine has.  It would have to be a 1/4"" with latching type switch. you would have to check with the manufacturer of the drum machine or the manual"
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Can this switch be used to start/stop  an electric drum machine,"Only if it somehow utilizes stereo jacks to do so, like a footswitch input for electronic drum hi hats. Most likely you want a midi toggle switch of some sort."
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Does this switch require one or two cables?,"You just need one TRS 1/4"" cable. It has two male connections on one side and one male connection on the other"
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Does this switch require one or two cables?,It utilizes a single TRS cable
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Does this switch require one or two cables?,It takes 1 TRS cable 1/4in. Basically a stereo 1/4in cable
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Does this switch require one or two cables?,1 cable but it has to be a TRS cable like used for stereo signals not just a typical guitar cable.
Musical_Instruments,B000VXKUL0,Can i use it to change channels on a marshall mg amplifiers?,Only if the marshall amp has a stereo 1/4'' footswitch jack.
Musical_Instruments,B000WKY4C8,Can you use this for Christmas lights? Thanks,"Yes but it is not waterproof, and Is a little expensive to be using only for one season."
Musical_Instruments,B000WKY4C8,Can you use this for Christmas lights? Thanks,"Yes you can. LED lights may not work with this dimmer, but regular incandescent lights will. Just remember that if you want to fade the lights, to set dipswitch 11 and 12 to the ON position (off for switching mode)"
Musical_Instruments,B000WKY4C8,Can you use this for Christmas lights? Thanks,"Assuming you have a DMX controller to tell this unit what to do, yes, you can plug Christmas lights into the unit so long as the Christmas lights are incandescent (not LED) style.  If you will be configuring the unit to just turn on and off lights, LEDs will be OK, but if you are trying to dim LED's you may get unexpected results unless the LED lights are designed to be dimmed.  Again, just be aware that you need a DMX controller for this unit to be practical.  Hope this helps."
Musical_Instruments,B000WKY4C8,Can you use this for Christmas lights? Thanks,It would be an overkill. And is not intended for outdoor exposure. Short answer is nope!

Musical_Instruments,B000WTWXFE,How would you compare to Pro tools? Is Sony PCM better than Pro Tools?,It's hard to say as that's a pretty broad discussion.  Pro Tools is essentially an editing/mixing suite. They're not really interchangeable.  But they ARE compatible.  You can download files from it onto Pro-Tools no problem.
Musical_Instruments,B000WTWXFE,Can you use its USB to connect to your laptop while recording? (as a simultaneous backup?),"no, it's basically a thumb drive when USB is connected, must disconnect USB to use as recorder,"

Musical_Instruments,B000ZJWI2O,Does it come with a cable? Can the cable be unplugged from the pickup?,"The pickup has a cable attached, but it cannot be removed from the pickup. You'd have to unplug the cable at the amp or remove the pickup from the soundhole, which is somewhat easy to do."
Musical_Instruments,B000ZJWI2O,Does it come with a cable? Can the cable be unplugged from the pickup?,Cable is included but cannot be unplugged from the pickup. So if you want to have it affixed to your guitar you will have to do someting extra with the cable.

Musical_Instruments,B0012AUHXW,Would this be a good starting microphone for YouTube,In that the quality is good enough for any application. Master audio quality. Save for very costly studio mics. For YouTube should be more that sufficient.
Musical_Instruments,B0012AUHXW,Does the recording of a voice reading from a manuscript go into an identifiable file that could be emailed?,"This microphone would work perfectly fine for that. What you will want to do, however, is download a free program called Audacity. Audacity will let you record your voice through  the mic, and will allow you to export the audio file with any name into a massive variety of formats from .mp3 to WAV file types once you have recorded what you want."
Musical_Instruments,B0012AUHXW,Does the recording of a voice reading from a manuscript go into an identifiable file that could be emailed?,"No. It's just a microphone: a hardware that captures sound.Making a recording, saving it as a particular file-type (identifiable or not), and emailing said file are all software functions. Most operating systems (Windows, Mac) have built-in recording software that can perform your function.Alternatively, as Trey mentioned, Audacity is a better-than-most-software-gold-standard that can record and manipulate sound files."
Musical_Instruments,B0012AUHXW,Compatible with Chrome OS?,"i haven't tried chrome os, but i have used it with other linux distros"

Musical_Instruments,B0015YM828,How would this work when used directly to an in-house PA for electric guitar or the house board?  Wanting to use in place of taking an amp to a gig.,Not gonna sound as good as an amp. But it could work.
Musical_Instruments,B0015YM828,How would this work when used directly to an in-house PA for electric guitar or the house board?  Wanting to use in place of taking an amp to a gig.,"This is not designed to be used as a ""stand alone"" effects processor.  It is not going to sound all that great going straight into a board, simply because it lacks any type of amp or speaker cab simulation.  All you're sending to the board is your guitar signal with the effects in the Nova System... no amp simulation for tone or anything like that.  Best bet if you're going to be going direct a lot is to look at something like the Boss GT series, or the Line 6 POD series multi effects processors.  They will have all the effects, plus various types of amp and speaker cabinet choices."
Musical_Instruments,B0015YM828,How would this work when used directly to an in-house PA for electric guitar or the house board?  Wanting to use in place of taking an amp to a gig.,"If you're going to use it for clean sound it should be OK, of course it won't sound as good as a real amp. The distortion and drive effects on this unit are not really that good though, so they're almost useless without an amp, if you intend to use the Nova for distorted sound."
Musical_Instruments,B0015YM828,Is the speaker emulation assignable or is it global?,Global. But relatively easy to turn off and on
Musical_Instruments,B0015YM828,Do you need a volume or wah pedal with this,"The Nova System does not include any expression pedal, but any exp pedal with a linear pot with an  impedance comprised between 25 and 50 KOhm will work. I´ve tested it with a Boss FV-300L with no issues."
Musical_Instruments,B0015YM828,Do you need a volume or wah pedal with this,It has neither a volume pedal nor a way. So yes -- you would need external pedal to get those two controls.

Musical_Instruments,B0061ZPCUQ,Is protools 11 compatible with an  Audio-Technica AT2035 microphone,"Yep. Any XLR mic will work. USB mic, no."
Musical_Instruments,B0061ZPCUQ,Is protools 11 compatible with an  Audio-Technica AT2035 microphone,"Well yes, but in a very round-about way.  This microphone must connect to a phantom powered mixer/ interface.  This in turn must connect to the computer (via USB, Firefire, or Audio Interface).  This must go through several layers of the operating system which in turn must communicate with Protools.  So to answer your question, this would be a fine microphone to use with protools.  However several things along the way could be incompatible, or mis-configured.  Such problems might have nothing to do with either the microphone or protools."

This Fog Machine although it is marked at 700 is really more a marketing gimmick by the manufacturer than anything else. This machine is marked at 3.9 watt if you read the info on the Amazon web site and yet they call it a ""700 Fog Machine"". The truly bigger machines generally don't have the clogging problems because they have higher motors equal higher watts. Hopefully, this helps."

Musical_Instruments,B0002E2TTO,Overall diminisions of case?,"The interior size of the case is actually smaller than advertised.  It is very cushioning and protective though.

About 9"" or 8"" for the drum and 16"" for the neck, thank you !","i don't think so, you know the size and the shape of a mandolin are quite different from other instruments. even though the size fits, you can't be sure that the shape and depth goes well too."

Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,What does this do that a multi-meter will not?,"This device allows checking all pins of connectors at the same time, check for intermittent connections and check for shorted, broken or swapped connections just by plugging cable in. Also can inject a mic-level or line-level signal into connection to help trace problems. A multi-meter cannot do this. Leave the multi-meter in the drawer and use this instead."
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,What does this do that a multi-meter will not?,"Well, this is optimized for all kinds of cables you might have as an audio engineer.Multimeters do the same, except this is better at testing if cables are damaged or not.. (you can bend and move the cable while its in the socket and see if it still works)Also can send a test tone for monitor calibration."
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,What does this do that a multi-meter will not?,"This cable tester is far better suited than a multimeter to verify opens, shorts, intermittents, or good cables because the user does not have to try to connect meter leads with cable pins of all kinds!  It's possible, but always awkward and time-consuming.  Further, even very brief intermittent opens or shorts are detected and the indication latched for easy observation by the cable tester. To see and verify these transient faults using a multimeter is difficult and unreliable;  much better to use a cable tester!"
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,What does this do that a multi-meter will not?,"It is a hugh time saver. You can check an XLR in seconds without having to try and hold a lead on a male pin with one hand and stick the lead into the female side at the same time. Throw it in your gig bag and know that you have not lost or misplaced a meter lead. On stage during a show, time is of the essence. It is just plane easier to use . XLR,TRS, TS, RCA, 1/8th inch. Instant checks with no fighting the cable. And also very inexpensive to boot."
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,What do the lights mean? The manual does not explain it. What pattern indicates good?,"That depends on what you are testing. For instance, when checking 1/4 inch cables the light patterns for good are like X's. When checking balanced cables you get something different. The best way to get used to it is to take known good cables and take note of the light patterns. Then take know bad cables and see what they give. Not complicated. good luck."
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,"will it test standard 1/4""  (TR)  besides the TRS 1/4""","Yes it easily tests TR & TRS 1/4"" cables.  In the case of TR cables, the tester will show that the Ring & Sleeve spots on the connector are connected together on the 9 indicator LEDs.  (That is true of all TR connectors.)"
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,"will it test standard 1/4""  (TR)  besides the TRS 1/4""","Yes, it just shows Ring & Sleeve connected"
Musical_Instruments,B000CCIVCA,"will it test standard 1/4""  (TR)  besides the TRS 1/4""","It will test 1/4"" TS (tip/sleeve) and 1/4"" TRS (tip/ring/sleeve), yes - there are lights for each of the three contacts."

Musical_Instruments,B000GQZHEW,"What's the difference between the 680.V3 and the 680E.V3?  And, are the styli interchangeable?","The simple answer is that the 680E.V3 has an ""elliptical"" stylus (or, needle). It is supposed to have better sound quality and requires less tracking force but will wear out your records faster. If you are a DJ who mostly mixes and does blends go with the E version. If you use Serato or another DVS then you should be looking at a different cartridge altogether."
Musical_Instruments,B000GQZHEW,does this cartridge fit the stanton t 50 turntable,Yes. Just mount it to the head shell.
Musical_Instruments,B000GQZHEW,does this cartridge fit the stanton t 50 turntable,Yes. That would fit stanton t 50.

Musical_Instruments,B000J5UEGQ,Can this mixer use two microphones at the same time?  How would you hook up two Audio-Technica ATR2100's into this?,"The only way you could make that work is with a splitter having both microphones feed the 1st (microphone) input.  The other inputs will not have a mic preamp.  You could use a separate input (not input #1) with a processor that had a LINE OUT, or use an add-on mic-preamp."
Musical_Instruments,B000J5UEGQ,Can this mixer use two microphones at the same time?  How would you hook up two Audio-Technica ATR2100's into this?,Technically you could hook up 5 mics but you would likely need an adapter from XLR to 1/4 phono for four of them and you would only have a 'Balanced' input for the one (whatever that means)
Musical_Instruments,B000J5UEGQ,does this power the microphone MXL 990?,You are probably right! In any event the sound was not acceptable. You may want to re-consider purchasing an external phantom powered unit to power your microphones.
Musical_Instruments,B000J5UEGQ,Can use a Dynamic Mic with out 48v like the SM58 Microphone?,Yes you could...not sure about recording with that type of mic though. Maybe for a small performance or something. But again it would be better to use a studio recording microphone. that dynamic mic you would need the jack for that type of mic.
Musical_Instruments,B000J5UEGQ,does this work with phantom powered microphones?,"Yes, the XLR input has phantom power. It's always on. I.e. There is no switch to turn on or off the phantom power."

From the pictures, it looks like they expect you to keep it lying flat on its back.","No problem however the case is positioned.This is probably the best humidifier for guitars. Very simple, neat and clean, and also balanced. The only possible down side is that the replacement packs are relatively expensive, given that they only last two months or so (maybe slightly longer under certain conditions)."

Musical_Instruments,B0010KAJKU,How do you connect this to a non-powered speaker and a dj controller?,"The best connection would be XLR (microphone) cables. It will depend on your DJ controller and the inputs it accepts and the same for the unpowered speakers. Most models should accept XLR input/output though. If the speaker cabs don't take XLR (3 prong mic cable) then they may need 1/4"" cables, which are pretty easy to find also but the sound will always be better with the XLR. Hope that helps."
Musical_Instruments,B0010KAJKU,How do you connect this to a non-powered speaker and a dj controller?,The DJ Controller has to have an out that is usually quarter inch plug that will go to an amplifier or crossover depending on what type of speakers you are hooking up. The dj controller or crossover will then have an output the you will connect to the input of the amp a/b on the far left side of the amp when looking at the back.  From there you will have to create a plug by twisting the wires to a black and red know and have a female plug to plug in a quarter inch speaker wire to the speaker. Hope this helps!

This stand is still sturdy enough to keep a b-foot flute vertical. Any wobbliness is from the difference in diameter of the stand's peg to the diameter of the flute's bore."
Musical_Instruments,B00126HUGS,Could one of them hold an alto flute?,"The flute and the alto flute seem to have the same foot joint, however the length and shape of the alto flute might necessitate a longer neck on the stand in order to accommodate balance problems.   Hope this helps."

Musical_Instruments,B004KCL5LW,"Can you record your entire band @ 1 time several songs, and then burn you a demo CD?..","You can only record two tracks at a time, so a whole band will not be possible unless you record each member at a time.

Musical_Instruments,B004KCL5LW,"Can you record your entire band @ 1 time several songs, and then burn you a demo CD?..","Hi Marty, You can only input 2 tracks at a time.. If you can record your band with 2 mikes.. then you burn to CD.. or if you have another mixer for more mikes and connect to 2 inputs of the 03 this would work well. You have 8 tracks on the 03 but can record only 2 at a time.. so mixer -- to 03 --- then burn Cd with 03 would work well.. 8 track mixers are not expensive, some under around 100$.. paul"
Musical_Instruments,B004KCL5LW,"Can you record your entire band @ 1 time several songs, and then burn you a demo CD?..","You can only record to two tracks at a time, either using two microphones or plugging directly into the machine. This unit has two built in condenser microphones which are actually pretty sweet, or you could plug in your own microphones and mic your practice space the best way to capture the entire band.   This would allow you to get a live two-track stereo recording of your band which you could then mix to the right and left for the true stereo sound.  It would just be a matter of trial and error as far as microphone placement is concerned to get the best sound.  Good luck!"

Musical_Instruments,B007SZJEJ8,"When it sits in the shockmount, it seems to bobble...is there a way to stabilize it?","It is supposed to ""bobble"" a bit... That's the whole point of the shockmount.  The more stiffly the mic is held, the more noise is transmitted to it as a result of physical motion (such as moving items on the table where the mic is sitting, or walking near the mic, etc.). The flexibility of the mount allows these vibrations to dissipate.  It IS possible for the elastic to be too loose (especially with age)... But as a general rule, the flexibility in the system is good."
Musical_Instruments,B007SZJEJ8,"When it sits in the shockmount, it seems to bobble...is there a way to stabilize it?","It's supposed to bobble- that is the ""shock suspension"" working. If it wasn't there and the surface was unstable or bumped, the noise would register. So basically, you definitely want to have the bobble."

Musical_Instruments,B00823R96U,Played acoustically could this instrument be used in place of upright acoustic bass?,"Having the larger dreadnought body makes it louder than most acoustic basses, but it's still not as loud as an upright.  If playing along with one or two acoustic guitars you'll be heard, but beyond that you'll need amplification. Unplugged = great for small quaint jamming. Also there is a wide tonal range that can be achieved through the preamp when plugged in.  With an amp you could make it sound very similar to an upright.Here's a great example of it's preamp's capabilities: http://youtu.be/ikmZ5YholGs"

Musical_Instruments,B0085UPTT4,Can this led strip be connected to a Malibu lights type outdoor power cable and controller?,"The LED lights require a DC voltage. Most Malibu light transformers supply AC voltage. But because LEDs act as diodes, it is possible the LED strip lights would work IF the voltage (must be 12V) is correct. You could cutoff a section to try it. You could also add a rectifier to convert the AC to DC."
Musical_Instruments,B0085UPTT4,"dumb question, cove lighting in a room, 15 feet long..  if i double the led strip, will it make it double brighter? (add 2 strips side by side)",Yes. The more lights the brighter it will be.  Not the individual light but the overall effect.

Musical_Instruments,B008B5LKUA,"Hello, does the ZT lunchbox junior amplifier work for acoustic guitars?",Not so good.

Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,Will this fit a Made In Mexico strat?,"No.  They use regular tremolo bridges, this is a double locking tremolo system.  Some people adapt the guitars but you have to cut through the timber (carpenters only)"
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,Will this fit a Made In Mexico strat?,yes it will fit any strat with a previous tremolo bridgebut you will not have a locking nut at the top of your neckto get full effect of the product ie dive bombing the tremolo arm to keep the guitar in tune you will need to have the locking nutI would suggest
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?","You have to cut off the ball end of the string, just as you would with a real Floyd Rose. The string end is clamped in by a set screw on the bridge saddle."
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?","The ball ends will not fit into this bridge. You have to clip the ball ends off with wire cutters and then you clamp the string into that saddle via the usually provided allen key. Additionally, this will not fit a standard Stratocaster without modifications, IE Routing and post/insert placement. You may have been told about Floyd Rose Bridges that do accept ball ends, but this is not that type of bridge."
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?","Just like every other Floyd rose,you have to cut the balls off the strings.for as cheap as this bridge is,it's great.looks great too"
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?",Yes it has a seat for the string bead to sit in
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?","The ball ends can either be fed through the tuning pegs or cut off. They won't fit in the Floyd itself. The best thing to to is to feed them through the tuners then down the neck into the bridge, because it will have even more of a lock to it"
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?","and i was reading previous answers, with adapting it to a strat you dont need to do all that. you just drill two holes and fill the older 6 holes. but its not just drill and youre done. you need to position them perfectly along with the neck, and just wide enough to squeeze the brackets in. they wont be aligned with the trem cavity, it will be off to the left a bit but thats normal. its called non recessed floyd rose trems. look it up itll help."
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,"Do the ball ends of the strings fit into this bridge? Or, on a Stratocaster, would the strings still be fed through the existing holes in the body?",you have to cut the ball end of the strings off and loosen the allen nuts ot the rear of the bridge- the cut string end goes into the bridge and then you tighten the allen holding the cut string -the strings are not fed through the body on any guitar with floyd rose
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,What type of guitar did you put it on?,So far i've installed them on a Kramer striker and a jackson kelly
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,What type of guitar did you put it on?,took it apart and mixed it with a silver one (thus making 2 mixed trems) i put one on a red and black strat and the other on a brown-stained hameln
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,Would this fit on a Fender MIJ 1986 Contemporary Telecaster?,"No. The tremolo unit on this guitar is a fender modified licensed Floyd rose tremolo and most likely built by Schaller. You will need to find one of similar build. The problems too, as you may be aware are that these guitars were build during a transitional period for Fender guitars and so there were many different styles and types of builds. The only good thing being that most of the Floyd Rose Tremolo units were made by Schaller and so you may be able to obtain replacement parts or units that will fit from them."
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,Would this fit on a Fender MIJ 1986 Contemporary Telecaster?,if it doesn't have the hole for the regular tremlo  wouldn't try it
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,Would this fit on a Fender MIJ 1986 Contemporary Telecaster?,don't know what kind og guitar this is but telecaster it would have to have a previous mounted tremolo for this guitar bridge to fit and be usableyou can mount it to any guitar but it would be in the fixed positionturn over the telecaster and see if it has underneath the bridge look for large cut out with springs attached if you have this you are good if you don't have this then the tremolo whammy bar will not work
Musical_Instruments,B008IYP8ES,Would this fit on a Fender MIJ 1986 Contemporary Telecaster?,It's possible. Measure the studs for the Fender Trem that came on the Tele from center of screw to center of screw and compare that measurement to the stud spacing on a Floyd Rose. That's the best way to find out. Check out Floyd Rose's site for the stud spacing. It will be the same as this Floyd Licensed trem.

It also has a knob to control the speed of the lights. However, if you want the lights to turn on whenever you power up the system, just leave the switch to on."
Musical_Instruments,B00EM7C6SQ,are the lights supposed to automatically come on when you turn music on,"The lights will come on with the music.  The louder you play, the brighter they are.  The tweeters activate most often."

Musical_Instruments,B00ENMZ0A6,How loud is it compared to a gas-powered leaf-blower? Would you run it at night or early morning without waking the neighbor?,"More like a weed whacker. Depending on how cranky your neighbors are, you should be able to run them at night or early morning without incurring a less than neighborly knock at your front door."

Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,"Does it function with any 30-pin to USB cable, or only the provided one?","The provided cable is different, it goes from 30pin to USB type B, not type A. For more, see this: http://www.l-com.com/content/USB-Connector-Chart.html"
Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,"Does it function with any 30-pin to USB cable, or only the provided one?","You would not want to use any adapters on the USB B side of the connection cable. The fat part of that cable has special electronics to meet iOS and iConnectMIDI2+ specs. You can use an Apple 30-pin to lightning on the other side, but avoid anything on the USB B side when using device ports."
Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,Does it come with a lightning cable?,"Sebastian J. - the 30pin to Lightning adapter is needed to connect the supplied cable, which has the ""square"" USB end to 30 pin Apple end.  USB connects to the iConnect box and the 30pin connects to the adapter which plugs into (newere) IPads.  If you have an older IPad, you are good to go with the included cable."
Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,Does it come with a lightning cable?,Now the Lightning version of this product is available. Be sure to select this one if you need Lightning.

Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,Does it come with a lightning cable?,no lightning. this is a usb interface
Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,"So, it does not come with any cables? How about the power supply?","Hey, it has a old style iDevice cable - you have to buy a lightning adapter. It does NOT come with a power supply - you don't need one for it to work - but if you do get one it will keep your iDevice charged. Buy the power supply from their web site. Also if u have lightning devices use an official apple one (per iconnect support).HTHThom"
Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,"So, it does not come with any cables? How about the power supply?","It comes with all of the connectivity cables, however, it does not come with a power supply. It is powered by USB sufficiently. It is an awesome solution for iPad MIDI."
Musical_Instruments,B00EV4A0PG,"So, it does not come with any cables? How about the power supply?",Its bus powered so you do not need the power supply unless you want the iOS device to charge - since bus power has a power  limitation. All connection cables are included.  Use an Apple 30-pin to lightning adapter for newer generation iOS devices.

Musical_Instruments,B00F07YF90,how many different instruments can it sound like and how close are the sounds to real,"It has a good dozen or so instruments plus variants (like multiple sorts of piano, that kind of thing). The real-ness of it is above average, but not great."

Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3L,Will it replace an Ortofon 20?,Yes it will.  The ortofon 20 though is a better cartridge.  You will hear the difference.
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3L,Will it replace an Ortofon 20?,"Yes, this AT92E should replace the Ortofon.  If you have the OMP-20, it is already a ""P-mount"" type and the AT will plug into the headshell as the OMP does (you may have to remove a securing screw first).  If you have the OM-20, this is a standard 1/2 inch screw mount and you can use the 1/2 inch adapter that comes with the AT to replace the Ortofon."
Musical_Instruments,B00006HO3L,Have technics SL-B20 turtable. Uses cartridge ATL12E2. Is the AT92E compatible? Plug looks the same,Almost all turntables are either P-mount or half in screw mount. This is P-mount as pictured and comes with an adapter for screw mount. Should fit.

Musical_Instruments,B00008BWM7,How often to you recommend replacing the stylus on this cartridge?,"Every 800 to 1000 hours of play. If you play 3 albums a day replace every 12 months,4 albums a day every 8 months. You'll notice inner groove distortion as sylus starts to wear out"
Musical_Instruments,B00008BWM7,How often to you recommend replacing the stylus on this cartridge?,"It really depends on how much you use your turntable. If you use it a lot, perhaps every 6 months is a good rule of thumb. If you know of a store that has a stylus inspection microscope, they might be willing to check it for you. A diamond stylus typically has a life expectancy of around 1000 hours, but there can be other factors, such as records that are in less than stellar condition, that can accelerate wear. Remember, if you start to hear anything out of the ordinary, change the stylus."
Musical_Instruments,B00008BWM7,How often to you recommend replacing the stylus on this cartridge?,4-6 months depending on how often used
Musical_Instruments,B00008BWM7,will this work on a Onkyo quartz locked cp-1044f?,"Exactly as Russell responded, make sure to buy the cartridge/stylus combo as the cartridge is specific to this stylus and will work 100 percent. Also make sure you have a head shell and head shell wires, most are universal."
Musical_Instruments,B0002BG2S6,"Description: ""It has 2 1/4"" inputs and 3 sets of stereo RCA inputs that are mixed to MONO."" Are the L and R inputs really mixed together?","apparently Amazon confused the description. There is a Rolls MX51 and a Rolls MX51s. The non-s has 1/4"" inputs and mixes to mono.

Musical_Instruments,B0002BG2S6,Output [both RCA and the headphone] fed to speaker produces very low sound. Tried another brand of speakers with same results. Any one had this issue?,"The Rolls product is a just a mixer. It does not contain a power amplifier, which is necessary to drive a speaker to a useable volume level. This is why you can barely hear the audio through speakers."
Musical_Instruments,B0002BG2S6,Output [both RCA and the headphone] fed to speaker produces very low sound. Tried another brand of speakers with same results. Any one had this issue?,both the line/headphone output and RCA output are in the same circuit so having something plugged into both at the same time halves the signal strength
Musical_Instruments,B0002BG2S6,"Has anyone used this mixer for pod cast or voice over recording? If so, can you give some feedback? Thanks","Also, if what you want to do is hook up a studio-quality microphone to your computer (rather than mix several audio inputs in realtime) you're better off with a dedicated mike preamp like the Art Tube Studio and a USB sound card (cheap ones are fine)."

Musical_Instruments,B0009K9MUA,The hanger holds one end of the guitar. What keeps the other end from banging against the wall?,It's a mount... It holds it away from the wall so the bottom won't hit
Musical_Instruments,B0009K9MUA,The hanger holds one end of the guitar. What keeps the other end from banging against the wall?,The guitar hangs a few inches from the wall.  The weight of the guitar keeps it hanging straight.  Not a problem.

Musical_Instruments,B0009K9MUA,The hanger holds one end of the guitar. What keeps the other end from banging against the wall?,How far the hanger holds the neck/headstock away from that very wall.
Musical_Instruments,B0009K9MUA,How do you get it to stop swinging from side to side (as in the hanger is able to move easily from the base)?,There is a nut built into the wood block and you must turn the metal part in until it is tight. Have 2 of them now and both work great.
Musical_Instruments,B0009XH4HU,does this come with a 9 volt battery,"The battery isn't included, though it can be powered that way.  If you plan to use the mixer mostly in one location, you may prefer to get an AC adapter and plug it in to your house current.  The unit doesn't require anything fancy; just about any 9-volt adapter will do the job."
Musical_Instruments,B0009XH4HU,does this come with an adapter,No but you can get one from amazon
Musical_Instruments,B0009XH4HU,Can you run 8 things into this amp if you do not use it mono? Can you run 8 things through it if you run it mono?,"It has up to four stereo channels total.  You can mix in eight individual component inputs only if they're mono.  Basically, two sources (times four) will be preamped together, but that shouldn't be a problem, since all eight have their separate volume controls.  Keep in mind that these are strictly line inputs; therefore, they might not produce enough gain for use of a microphone (if that's a consideration), unless you connect it through a mic preamp."

Musical_Instruments,B000AJR482,can i hook up to speakers,"If you have powered speakers, then yes. If not, you will need to run this straight to a power amp and then to speakers that are compatible with that power amp."

Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Does this work well from monitor send on a Peavey PV 10 mixer,Definitely. Will work with aux or monitor send from any mixer that has those sends. Still using the monitor weekly and loving it.
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Does this work well from monitor send on a Peavey PV 10 mixer,"Depends on whether the mixer is a ""powered"" mixer or not.  This is a ""powered"" (active) monitor, so it's meant to be used with a ""non-powered"" mixer.  In other words you EITHER amplify at the mixer and use a ""passive"" monitor, or amplify at the monitor/speaker by using an ""active"" monitor (which this is). Actually, it will work with either, you just have to make sure you use the correct inputs."
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Does it work for electronic accordions?,"Not recomended, its to small, the speaker is 6.5. Unless you need a portable amplifier. It sounds really clean for its sice."
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Does it work for electronic accordions?,Your accordion is probably louder by itself.
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Does it work for electronic accordions?,"It's listed on the Roland website as an accessory for their V-Accordions, so the answer would have to be ""YES!"""
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Where is it manufactured?,These are made in China. Thanks Rick.
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Does it work as an amp?,"Yes, that's what it is for. But just as amplification though, there are no effects such as reverb or overdrive"
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Can this Handel a base guitar with other instruments,Absolutely not! It couldn't even handle a single piano keyboard. It's alright for mids but terrible for lows and distorted for highs.
Musical_Instruments,B000OY4WA6,Can this Handel a base guitar with other instruments,"It would be good for vocals and mic'd acoustical instruments, but an electric bass guitar really should have it's own amp.  Find an amp that's designed specifically for bass guitar.  If you're on a tight budget, you might look for a used one on Craig's list, ebay, or at a pawn shop.  Even Amazon sometimes has used or refurbished stuff."

Musical_Instruments,B000QPHCB4,"Can a woofer go along with these, or would they be better alone?",whatever you like really. the speakers are really flat which is really good for mixing but if you like big boom a sub wont hurt. just have to learn your setup so your mixes dont come out bass heavy or lacking in bass
Musical_Instruments,B000QPHCB4,"Can a woofer go along with these, or would they be better alone?","The low end is great on these , if you need to focus on very low end frequencies you might add the HS10W sub."
Musical_Instruments,B000QPHCB4,"Can a woofer go along with these, or would they be better alone?","Depends on what you want.  There is a complimentary subwoofer you can get, but these go down to 40Hz fairly adequately."
Musical_Instruments,B000QPHCB4,"Can a woofer go along with these, or would they be better alone?",Yeah adding a woofer would be good if you have the right treatment in your room.

Saw the question & never thought of it?,"If you are a left-handed player you must switch the Nut and the Saddle around in order that the strings when set up for a left handed player fit properly. A guitar tech is recommended for doing this. It is not a big job but important to do it right, The cost should be reasonable."
Musical_Instruments,B000QRHA6E,Did you find the DVD helpful?,"Sorry, never used it since the guitar was purchased for starting lessons."

Musical_Instruments,B000U2G6VA,Do these come with wall mounts in the box?,Negative.... no hardware.
Musical_Instruments,B000U2G6VA,Do these come with wall mounts in the box?,"Yes, it is a ball and socket type mount. The ball has a threaded end that screws into the back of the speaker and the socket end can be attached to the wall with 4 screws (not included). A hand-turned knob applies tension to the ball when you have found the right angle to aim the speaker."
Musical_Instruments,B000U2G6VA,"Would it make sense to bounce these off the wall/ceiling, to get better dispersion in a small, relatively sonically active theater space?",Not sure but they may break if the wall or ceiling is concrete. :)
Musical_Instruments,B000U2G6VA,"Would it make sense to bounce these off the wall/ceiling, to get better dispersion in a small, relatively sonically active theater space?","Normally, no. What would probably make the most sense would be to mount them in a ""2pi"" configuration, in other words right at the boundary of wall and ceiling. With the ""u"" shaped mounting brackets you can do a little experimenting, but ""bouncing"" sound will usually result in loss of certain frequencies and a kind of ""smeared"" sound."
Musical_Instruments,B000U2G6VA,"Would it make sense to bounce these off the wall/ceiling, to get better dispersion in a small, relatively sonically active theater space?","No, if they are in a small room and are on the back wall in each corner, point them to the center of the room. So if they were lights the beam would cross in the center of the room."
Musical_Instruments,B000U2G6VA,Are the grills included with the speakers?,"Yes, the grills come with the speakers, and have the JBL Nameplate on the bottom as shown in the picture."
Musical_Instruments,B000ULAP4U,are these headphones over ear and are they comfortable?,"They aren't overly comfortable, if you want something super comfortable go with Beyerdynamic honestly they are better headphones."
Musical_Instruments,B000ULAP4U,are these headphones over ear and are they comfortable?,"They are very comfortable, but you need to used them frequently so the band will expand or you can put it in a box to let the headband be stretch and for sure it will be very comfortable after a few days."
Musical_Instruments,B000ULAP4U,are these headphones over ear and are they comfortable?,Yes and yes! Though comfort is subjective...
Musical_Instruments,B000ULAP4U,are these headphones over ear and are they comfortable?,If you have big ears it will start to hurt after wearing it.
Musical_Instruments,B000ULAP4U,are these headphones over ear and are they comfortable?,"Yes to both, however, you must wear them as indicated L & R, i.e,  the left ear cup on the left ear and the right cup on the right ear. It matters that you wear them correctly as the headband is mounted on the side of the ear cups at a very slight angle, which causes the headband to fit slightly forward on the head. If you wear them reversed, you might feel a little pressure on the top of your head."
Musical_Instruments,B000ULAP4U,does it the headphone jack fit with iphone 5 otterbox?,Has anyone found any iPhone cases that work with these headphones?

Musical_Instruments,B0010SHU18,Would this make the guitar a lot quieter for practicing? Or is it just for preventing feedback when amplified?,Your volume will stay the same. The screeching halt prevents all feedback when you're playing live or when amplified. It's great for shows.
Musical_Instruments,B0010SHU18,Does this work on an acoustic that has no electric part to it?,You wouldn't need this unless your acoustic is electric too..........It's purpose is to prevent feedback from amp through the guitar pickup.  Much like a microphone does.
Musical_Instruments,B0010SHU18,Does this work on an acoustic that has no electric part to it?,"This device suppresses feedback between the guitar's internal audio (electronic) pickups and amps and or/sound equipment.

Musical_Instruments,B0016ZZKJO,"does this have reverb too, and if not what's a great reverb pedal?","nope. and unlike the boss rv-5 reverb, the boss rv-3 reverb/delay has both delay and reverb- and does both well. it gives you the options of using just the reverb, just the delay, or both together. i don't think boss has issued it for a while now, but i'm sure, like with everything else, you could probably find it on-line. if you haven't purchased something yet - or have, but aren't satisfied - good luck in your search."

Musical_Instruments,B001LTTP1E,Do these speakers have phantom power for a beta87A microphone,"Aloha Tania, unfortunately these EON's do not have phantom power for any condenser mic's, however, use dynamic microphones like the SM58's and you will be surprised at how much gain the mic/line port has and the results of the quality of sound to boot. If you plan to use the 87's, you will have to plug in an external phantom unit or use a second mixer with phantom power. These 510 EONS will give you a quality of sound well worth the price point and years of undying performance anywhere!"

For instance, going from a verse loop to the chorus and back",i doubt it!....  its a basic all in one cheap machine limited by what it can do.only a small part of it is the looper itself. i have another dedicated looper also as you cannot have looper and drums together.this was a poor decision by digitech as everyone wants looper/drums together dont they?....but it is worth buying for the drum samples alone although they can only be changed by speed their still very good and unless your a real drums enthusiast they suffice for most people just to jam along to with their guitar thats all this machine really is.. is a bedroom practice machine

Musical_Instruments,B002GYWBIM,How is the clean tone?,"Clean is very good, the other settings are very loud - but can be set anyway you wish.  The effects are good, have to watch the echo, if it is not set off when powering up the amp, it makes a loud pop."
Musical_Instruments,B002GYWBIM,How is the clean tone?,"This amp can be as clean as you want it to be. It can be flat clean, meaning devoid of any character whatsoever, or you can dial it in for rich tones and substance. The website has a myriad of combinations; it's not an amp that makes a particular sound, but one that can be programmed to replicate whatever sound you're after."

This replaces the built in Clean model with your custom settings."

Musical_Instruments,B002GYWBIM,Does this model have artists pre-sets or do you have to buy the more expensive version to get those?,"That's why they built the tone of four sought-after amp tones (Clean, Crunch, Metal, and Insane), six effects, and loads of presets into the Line 6 Spider IV 15 combo! You get it all: vintage and modern amps, effects, even a huge collection of presets crafted by top players!  That said, this is a practice amp.  It does not have the readout of the different presets and is not powerful enough for performance use."
Musical_Instruments,B002GYWBIM,Does this amp works with any electric guitar or not?,"It will work on an electric regular guitar, not a bass guitar."

Musical_Instruments,B002R56C4O,how is the sound play playback using only the recorder?,The speaker is a little quiet. Headphones are OK though.
Musical_Instruments,B002RGPQJ0,does it come with metal plates(crash)?,If you are referring to cymbals when you asked about metal plates then the best answer i can give you is that the hardware that accompanies the set is definitely factory and if you are an experienced drummer you will want to buy different cymbals. The hardware for the set is durable but you get what you pay for and the set focuses on the quality of the set not the cymbals.
Musical_Instruments,B002RGPQJ0,WHAT AGE GROUP IS THIS FOR,"With the size the drums, 12 year old to adult."
Musical_Instruments,B002RGPQJ0,WHAT AGE GROUP IS THIS FOR,12 years  old to adult because it is a full sized drum set which means adult sized so about 11 or 12 to adult
Musical_Instruments,B002TP9154,Does this work on a Stanton T.92 turntable? With which cartridge?,"Yes it can be used with the T.92, and with any ""headshell-mountable"" cartridge (not the ""plug-in"" type.)"
Musical_Instruments,B002TP9154,Does is come with plastic clips to insulate the cartridge from the headshell?,"Depends on what you mean by ""insulate"".  The headshell is conductive, but is coated with non-conductive paint.  The only way you can tell it's conductive is that there is continuity between the cartridge mount screws, the extra weight screw, and the shield ring where the headshell mounts to the tone arm.  There is no continuity between the shell and any of the four signal wires.  HTH"
Musical_Instruments,B002TX7B4E,Is this compatible with FL Studio?,"Yes, it is, from 10.5 and up.  They have templates you start new projects directed towards it. Once you figure out Performance Mode, you can get it working on old projects."

Musical_Instruments,B002TX7B4E,does it come with dierictions on how to use it,Yes it comes with basic instructions on how to use it.  But if you want to know how to do really cool advanced things you should look at youtube videos.But when you buy this make sure to go to the novation website and download the latest driver or this device will run very slow.
Musical_Instruments,B002TX7B4E,does it come with dierictions on how to use it,"Yes, but it's a big light up pad that play sounds... what other directions do you need?"
Musical_Instruments,B002TX7B4E,does it come with dierictions on how to use it,"Not exactly how to function it, but to get started go to YouTube and look up ""how to use Novation Launchpad. It comes with a beginners disc of ableton software that will give you tips on how to use the studio and midi controllers such as the launchpad. But other than knowing how to perform on it will come inside the box showing how to connect it."

Musical_Instruments,B002X8Y4SQ,Can it be used with a keyboard / piano?,Experience says these 'cheaper' line pedals don't sound paired with anything other than guitar.Compression can be controlled with MIDI under live situations or added during recording mix.Also you don't have the control with guitar effect pedals as you would with the proper keyboard sustain pedal.Check keyboards that accept sustainer foot pedals; Sweetwater sells the pedals for $15.You can find them cheaper here on Amazon thru M-Audio for around $10.Keep looking and read up on it.
Musical_Instruments,B002X8Y4SQ,Can it be used with a keyboard / piano?,"Like Scott said, (try it) will give more sustain."
Musical_Instruments,B002X8Y4SQ,Is this pedal good enough for metal music (both rythm and solos) or do you think the behringer DC9 is better for this?,"The CS400 has better reviews than the DC9, plus you can tweak the tone and attack. For higher gain in metal, don't you think you need less compression except maybe for some leads? Plus you can boost your amp EQ without changing tone. You don't want your signal getting clipped depending on your pedal configuration. Google the MXR Super Comp and compare. The CS400 is worth the price."
Musical_Instruments,B002X8Y4SQ,Is this pedal good enough for metal music (both rythm and solos) or do you think the behringer DC9 is better for this?,"im not familiar with the dc9..so,i couldnt really tell you much in that regard..i do know that this pedal has lots of adjustment ranges and can be adjusted to trim your sound pretty good..they all take some trial and error experimentation..but boiled down basically,it'll compress your signal and increase your sustain pretty well ..for the money..its a pretty fair deal."
Musical_Instruments,B002X8Y4SQ,Does the tone knob affects the tone of the sound itself or its there for maintaining a main gain on certain point in the tone spectrum?,"Yes it affects the tone overall sound, but its a good function to ad highs."
Musical_Instruments,B0030G5YJI,Is this model USA-made?,"It says ""Made in PRC,"" so no, not US, China."
Musical_Instruments,B0030G5YJI,Is this model USA-made?,In the back write MADE IN PRC i think is China
Musical_Instruments,B0030G5YJI,Is this model USA-made?,No. It's from the UK.
Musical_Instruments,B0030G5YJI,"would this be a good amp to get for someone interested in playing hard rock/metal ie; metallica, children of bodom,or maybe three days grace/disturbed","Sure. If they'll be playing in their bedroom...It's a small amp and the preset ""effects"" are basically useless except for the reverb settings. You'll need to buy some decent distortion pedals for metal/hard rock. If they'll be playing in a metal band, this will probably be too small of an amp. But Orange as a brand is fantastic, so you can't go wrong purchasing larger models."
Musical_Instruments,B0030G5YJI,"would this be a good amp to get for someone interested in playing hard rock/metal ie; metallica, children of bodom,or maybe three days grace/disturbed",This amp is for practice it has some effects but yeah you can play anything but if you want more distortion you will need a pedal.

Musical_Instruments,B0033290CQ,What's the height dimensions,"Bass drum is 16"" tall (the drum that the two other toms mount on) and those toms are adjustable from there so you would add that size on top of the bass drum of the mounted toms. The cymbals also sits higher than the toms."

Musical_Instruments,B0033290CQ,What are the dimensions of the box it comes in?,"roughly 36"" x 36"""
Musical_Instruments,B0033290CQ,What are the overall dimensions for the set?,Its about 1/2 size of an adult set. About 3ft x5ft of floor space.

Musical_Instruments,B00332RD1G,Is it a dual voltage item for 110V U.S. & 220V Europe?,"No, it is not.  Just 110-120V US."

Musical_Instruments,B0035EHLZK,Could you hook up a ukulele and a keyboard together through this amp?,"Hi,The amp has three channels so a keyboard and another instrument (another keyboard, guitar etc.) can be connected. Your ukulele would have to have a pickup for being amplified of course. Just to let you know that though your ukulele will play through the amp, it is not designed for stringed instruments but is designed for keyboards and especially geared for stereo hookup as the amp is supurb for giving rich stereo sounds. FYI. The amp can also be used as a small PA or monitor with a microphone connected as well."
Musical_Instruments,B0035EHLZK,Could you hook up a ukulele and a keyboard together through this amp?,Yes there are separated channels for this purpose.  You can mic the instruments or use a 1/4 cable connection.  It works very well.  However there is combined tone controls area.   So all inputs use the same settings.
Musical_Instruments,B0035EHLZK,Could you hook up a ukulele and a keyboard together through this amp?,The Amp/Speaker has 3 channels which would allow for a mic. and two other instruments that would be controlled individually along with a master volume control
Musical_Instruments,B0035EHLZK,Could you hook up a ukulele and a keyboard together through this amp?,Install a Piezo pick-up on the uke and you'll be home free. A keyboard has 5 times the range of a string instrument so a uke and a keyboard would be no problem at all.
Musical_Instruments,B0035EHLZK,"Would a single one of these speakers be sufficient for a medium size outdoor gig (Wedding, reception, bonfire, etc) ?","It would probably be loud enough if you were playing by yourself... If with other intruments,esp drums, no..."
Musical_Instruments,B0035EHLZK,"Has anyone tried this with an electric guitar and pedal set-up? If so, how well does it sound (depth etc.)?","The piano has a much larger range than a guitar, so playing the guitar through the Roland KC-110 should not be a problem.  Roland also makes similar dedicated guitar amps called ""Street"".  The KC-110 is an amazing little amp that really packs a wallop!  Guitar amps make very poor keyboard amps, but the reverse is not true. Good luck and keep playin'."

It streams at 192 Kbps (thousand bits per second). The first is a measure of sampling frequency, the second is a measure of audio compression. The Pandora 192 Kbps stream will be a 16-bit audio file sampled at 44.1 kilohertz, so there will be no problem using this DAC."
Musical_Instruments,B0038O4UFQ,Pandora One streams at 192 kHz. How will this DAC perform with Pandora One?,This company makes a music Streamer model called the HD that will stream up to 192khz.http://highresolutiontechnologies.com/music-streamer-hdHope that helps.

Musical_Instruments,B0039PPW60,How to hook speakers up to mixer,"Simple answer.  If your speakers are powered speakers, then you simply connect XLR speaker cable(s) from the ""Main Output"" jacks on the back of the mixer directly into the XLR input jacks on the back of the speakers.  If your speakers are not powered (i.e., passive speakers), then you will need to connect the Main Output cable(s) from the mixer to an amplifier first (such as a powered mixer or head).  Then connect speaker cables from amplifier's speaker outputs into the input jacks on the speakers."
Musical_Instruments,B0039PPW60,How to hook speakers up to mixer,"U don't connect speakers to the mixer, u connect speakers to the amplifier that is powering u'r system"

Musical_Instruments,B0039PPW60,Does it come wih effects?  Is it good?,"Not sure what responders are talking about here. The X1204USB does indeed built in FX but the 1204USB model doesn't (and is $30 cheaper).. Just look at the top right of the board where it lists all the preset effects... reverb, chorus, delay, etc..."
Musical_Instruments,B0039PPW60,Does it come wih effects?  Is it good?,No effects are included with this particular model but it's a good mixer for the money.
Musical_Instruments,B0039PPW60,what does it sound like recording wise no hissing or static ?,"Recording digitally over the USB eliminates most of the static or hissing.  It is still possible that the guitar picks up some interference along the way, but just don't play in front of the microwave and turn your cell phone off when you are recording.  Also, try to utilize a common ground if you have several powered devices to avoid ground loops (I.e. plug everything into the same power strip)."
Musical_Instruments,B003AJHZFG,Is it possible to connect th midi keytar it to the Behringer UMX610and play all the sounds from the UMX610 through,"Unfortunately, no it is not."

Musical_Instruments,B003ELQ2D6,Does the hard case fit inside this case?,"No, the hard case does not fit inside. There is a built in form with velvet cover that you put your flute pieces in. Probably very similar to the inside of your hard case.So this replaces your hard case."

Musical_Instruments,B003ELQ2D6,Does the hard case fit inside this case?,"No, the hard flute case does not fit inside this case.

Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"Can these be played without being hooked up to anything with cords? In other words, can you carry them around while playing like a traditional violin?","Yes, actually. It's very similar to an electric guitar, where you can still play without an amp, but it's just really quiet. You can't really perform on one without something, but you can still play without one."
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"Can these be played without being hooked up to anything with cords? In other words, can you carry them around while playing like a traditional violin?","takin' in account that this is an electric you won't be able to do that unless you are using a wireless amp or headphones, earphones"
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"Can these be played without being hooked up to anything with cords? In other words, can you carry them around while playing like a traditional violin?",Due to the design of the electric violin it will not make the sound of a traditional violin unless it's plugged in.
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"Can these be played without being hooked up to anything with cords? In other words, can you carry them around while playing like a traditional violin?","The violin is not silent. In other words, it makes noise when you play. However, it is not an acoustic violin, which means that it is not loud enough to play without it being plugged in with cords. So, you do need cords, unless you are able to find a wireless device that connects to a PA system. You may want to look for an acoustic/electric violin."
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"How quiet is ""silent"" (...on a scale of won't-wake-up-the-baby to regular acoustic sound.)","It's not silent. But, it's pretty quiet, especially if you bow it lightly. You can also use headphones with it. It is definitely much quieter than a regular violin."
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"How quiet is ""silent"" (...on a scale of won't-wake-up-the-baby to regular acoustic sound.)","When you plug in the head phones, you won't wake up the baby at all even if you are playing in the same room, and you can hear what you are playing with the ear phones. It is very quiet."
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,"How quiet is ""silent"" (...on a scale of won't-wake-up-the-baby to regular acoustic sound.)","How about might wake up the baby. this can definately be heard in the next room, but not next door."
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,This is for an accomplished teen violinist.  Will the sound likely be okay if he is used to a nice violin or is the sound/quality more for a beginner?,"The sound is pretty typical of electronic violins.  It is fine for practice.  If used for performance, external amplification and tonal controls will be required and the quality of the sound will be dependent more on the quality of those devices than on this instrument.  If he has a decent standard violin, he will be dissapointed in the dynamic range of this or any other electronic instrument."
Musical_Instruments,B003F1HVDU,This is for an accomplished teen violinist.  Will the sound likely be okay if he is used to a nice violin or is the sound/quality more for a beginner?,"It has a decent quality to it. By no means does it convey greatness, but if he is still in training; it might just save you a few hundred dollars (should he do as teenagers do and break it)."

Musical_Instruments,B003T2SLIO,Will this booster work with the Comcast Xfinity X1 system?,"Robert, this amp does not work for cable box to cable box communication.  The boxes use the spectrum above 1 Gig to communicate with each other.  The reverse on this amp is between 5 and 54 Meg.  It is designed to exit your property and talk back to your Cable provider.  If you attach this amp to all your boxes, it can actually make it worse because the amp is not designed to push above 1 Gig.  It would be best to have your cable company balance all of your outlets so the boxes can communicate best with each other."

Musical_Instruments,B0048KM70Y,can you plug headphones into the 8 outputs on back with separate mixes for playback while recording?,"It would probably work, 'BUT"", a headphone is an unbalanced stereo device and the outputs on the Octa are balanced mono.  You will need to use two outputs configured as stereo per headset.  Also you will need 4 ""Y"" adapters to get  the signal to the headsets.  The other option would be to create adapters that will take the mono out and send it to both sides of the stereo headset connector.  This assumes that the output is a full mix of course.  If you are looking for a headset kilt /amp those are a lot cheaper than the Octa is."
Musical_Instruments,B0048KM70Y,Is there phantom power on this bad boy?  And does it work with Windows 8.1?,"All of the xlr inputs  has the option to have phantom power. If you have a dynamic microphone, you can remove the Phantom power and plug the microphone. In short,  you can have a mix of inputs that require phantom power and no phantom power.  The Roland drivers for Windows are very stable in Windows 8.1."
Musical_Instruments,B0048KM70Y,Is there phantom power on this bad boy?  And does it work with Windows 8.1?,"48V?  there's a switch but i've never used it so can't comment on quality.   8.1? definitely, and 64 bit.driver is decent, software bus has good features."

Musical_Instruments,B0048KM70Y,Is there phantom power on this bad boy?  And does it work with Windows 8.1?,"Hi Aaron, To answer your questions: 1. Yes, there is phantom power on the XLR inputs. From Roland's site: ""Eight XLR inputs are provided for the preamps, plus independent phantom power, low-cut filter, phase invert, and digital compression for each channel.""2. Windows 8. Yes, Roland's site has drivers for Windows 8."
Musical_Instruments,B0048KM70Y,Is there phantom power on this bad boy?  And does it work with Windows 8.1?,"Yes, each of the eight microphone inputs has its own switchable phantom power supply. It works with Windows 7 and 8, but you need to ensure you have the correct drivers."

Musical_Instruments,B0048KM70Y,"Acording to Cakewalk's website, Cakewalk Sonar x1 LE supports up to 24/96.  So how do you record 4 track 24/192 if the bundled software doesn't?",The LE version of Sonar x1 is a stripped down version of the full version of Sonar. It limits you in many ways i.e limiting your session to 24/96. it basically there to get your feet wet before you dive into the full version.

In other words, press buttons on remote A or B and both receiver A and B will respond, IF the signal is strong enough. There is no coding or pairing involved.

Standard nylon strings will work fine, but give a slightly easier feel on the frets. High tension strings might be closer to standard tension, but would be harder to fret. It looks close enough to be a personal choice either way.I have large hands with think fingers and can play instruments down to a 14  inch scale, so the size should be no problem."

Musical_Instruments,B004ZHHIVI,What is the difference between this metal volume box amp attenuartor and the 8 ohm 50 watt speaker soak?,"It's  a big difference.  The volume box is run in the effects loop and the 50 w. attenuator is run between you head and speaker cabinet. So the volume box really only has an effect on preamp tubes. If you are looking to get that power tube breakup like a master volume get the attenuator. Just be certain you get the right one for your amp. A lot of power goes through it, and attenuators will get too hot and will fail. You could cause serious damage to your amp.  ."

Musical_Instruments,B005ST3XW0,"Which leads do you wire to obtain warm white color? Pictures show only two leads or RGB, but product that arrived had four un-labled leads?","Pretty much the same answer as ""S.Conway"":  There is only one color, which is somewhere between neutral and warm white.  For each group of three LEDs, there is one common +12 and three separate common/negative pads.  If you remove the solder blob across these three pads and connect three independant common/negative wires, then you can run each one of the three LEDs independently.  This continues throughout the entire ribbon, so every third LED is controlled by one common/negative pad, but all share the same +12V pad."
Musical_Instruments,B005ST3XW0,"Which leads do you wire to obtain warm white color? Pictures show only two leads or RGB, but product that arrived had four un-labled leads?","The warm white LED uses the same circuit board as the RGB(Red Green Blue). Each physical LED has three LED's inside, so one is connected to the red lead and one is connected to the green lead and the last is connect to the blue lead. So the - power connects to the RGB and + connects to the last or fourth lead. that should be labled +12. If you wanted to change the light output you could only connect to one or two of the RGB pads on the circuit strip."

Musical_Instruments,B005UDTIUA,i was wondering if this drum set is quiet?,"If you mean acoustically, as in the actual noise made by hitting the pads? It sounds like bashing a heap of cardboard boxes.

Musical_Instruments,B005UDTIUA,i was wondering if this drum set is quiet?,"It can be quiet if you plug in earphones, then you'll only hear the taps on the pads. E-drums are made to play loud or in private which is why they are the best for anything. This model in particular is much like the others."

Musical_Instruments,B0006ZXF74,Goofy question: Why are violin strings so crazy expensive compared to much-longer guitar strings?  Why not buy a Uke or Guitar set & adapt to violin?,Violin strings are more difficult to make than guitar strings and the materials are more costly. They use aluminum all the way to tungsten. Aluminum and silver are the most common. Thanks.
Musical_Instruments,B0006ZXF74,Goofy question: Why are violin strings so crazy expensive compared to much-longer guitar strings?  Why not buy a Uke or Guitar set & adapt to violin?,"Violin strings are more complicated to manufacture than guitar and ukulele strings.  Most of the time, guitar and ukulele strings are steel strings and, occasionally nylon.  Violin strings are made out of much more costly materials, such as, aluminum, tungsten, silver etc.  Also, a lot of higher quality violin strings are actually hand-made!"
Musical_Instruments,B0006ZXF74,are these strings ball end?,yes they are ball end
Musical_Instruments,B0006ZXF74,Why the sound of the E is so muted? The A string has the similar problem to some extent. Never had this problem with previous set of strings.,"This may be a problem with the way the strings were applied to your instrument as opposed to the strings themselves... or you could have gotten a couple with manufacturing errors (it happens sometimes). Check your bridge, your pegbox, and your tailpiece, see if there is anyplace the strings look ""off"". You can always remove and re-string those two strings as well to see if that might fix it.At worse, just contact the seller, explain the issue, and get another set. Ask for a prepaid shipping label to return the current strings if they want you to return it."

Musical_Instruments,B000MJ406Y,Can it be used in a car?,"No, this isn't for cars. There are plenty of car EQ's, which are designed to run on 12 volts and have subwoofer outputs. You should get one meant for car stereo use."

Musical_Instruments,B001PGXKC8,are these necessary to use boss-dd7 ?,"Im not sure i understand your question. You need two cables for any single pedal.

Musical_Instruments,B001PGXKC8,are these necessary to use boss-dd7 ?,"Jeffrey, you don't necessarily need this brand of cable. but you will need something like it to run a few pedals. If you just have one pedal however, like the DD-7, you can just use 2 long enough cables to go from your (1) guitar to the pedal then (2) back to the amp. Hope your question has been answered."
Musical_Instruments,B001PGXKC8,are these necessary to use boss-dd7 ?,You can use any pedal with any cable with 1/4 jack. These small cables are use if you have more than one pedal so can connect them together one close to the other. Hope it helps!!
Musical_Instruments,B001PGXKC8,are these necessary to use boss-dd7 ?,"These cables are great for effects pedals and connecting in between your preamp output and amp input (known as the effects loop) of your amplifier.

Musical_Instruments,B001PGXKC8,Are these good for plugging a pedal directly into an amp? Ex. Are they long enough,"It's not designed for this, but if you're going to let it on the top of the amp and turn it on/off with your hands, no problem, they're  long enough for that. But it is not normal, so if you change your mind along the way, it might not be a good deal."

Musical_Instruments,B001R2LQWQ,What are the differences between the me70 and the me50?? what extra effects does it have??,"You're going to have a hard time finding someone who owns both.

The fret board over hangs the end of the neck as well and it is about .030 wider than a strat or a tele.  If you want it to fit a tele body you can trim back the fret board to cut off the last fret with a bit of the heal to flatten the curve and it will fit just fine.  Just depends on your skill level.

Musical_Instruments,B00E8CEW7I,Using with focusrite saffire usb 6; volume at max is not very loud.  why?,"There are three things that come to mind. One, check that your computer volume is turned up. The focus rite is an interface and relies on your computer as well. Second, is the volume on the monitor turned up? There is a small volume adjustment on the back of the monitors. Third, make sure your speakers are wired in phase. This means that positive goes to positive on both monitors. If one speaker is wired backwards, they will be out of phase and can cause the sound to not sound as loud."

It requires a controller that supports 4 or more channels per device.   3 Channels will not work because either you get to set the RGB colors ( 3 channels) but then you can't make them bright or dim (4th channel).

It messed up the color of the strings. As far as muting the strings, it depends on how tight u have it. If it muted the strings, u have the capo on too tight."
Musical_Instruments,B0002CZVU0,"Anyone else find that you're between slots on this capo - too tight and it pulls the guitar sharp and too loose and strings are 'muted', not capo'd?","Yes. This is why they came out with the pro-model, which has a buckle to make the length of the strap adjustable too.

Musical_Instruments,B0002E363C,"is this a set that has hand-held cards by a leader, so bell players can follow the cards via colors?",There is a very tiny booklet of songs included. ( it's like 3 inches square) Nothing a group could see from any distance.

Musical_Instruments,B0002E4Z8M,Do you need a mixamp/preamp/mixer/audio interface to use this microphone on a PC or is it optional?,You definitely need a preamp and audio interface or an audio interface that includes at least one mic preamp. Also the preamp you use will need quite a bit of gain as this mic has a fairly low output level.
Musical_Instruments,B0002E4Z8M,Do you need a mixamp/preamp/mixer/audio interface to use this microphone on a PC or is it optional?,This is a good expensive XLR Mic.  So as such you may want to pair this with the Shure X2U (XLR to USB) Signal Adapter which costs $99 at Amazon.   You can now use this MIC with your PC.
Musical_Instruments,B0002E4Z8M,Do you need a mixamp/preamp/mixer/audio interface to use this microphone on a PC or is it optional?,Short answer is yes. The microphone has a very low level output. There are many preamps that will work just fine. Great choice for voice work.

Musical_Instruments,B0002E4Z8M,Do you need a mixamp/preamp/mixer/audio interface to use this microphone on a PC or is it optional?,You want at least 60db of gain.
Musical_Instruments,B0002E4Z8M,What would be an affordable preamp for podcasting and voice over work for the SM7B?,You can buy a Mackie 402-VLZ3 mixer for $99 on Amazon. Nice clean preamps and it will power the Shure SM7B. This will also now give you a mixer to use with other things and inputs. It has some onboard EQ also. http://www.amazon.com/Mackie-4-Channel-Compact-Preamps-402VLZ4/dp/B00GYFFP8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1386177530&sr;=1-1&keywords;=mackie+mixer
Musical_Instruments,B0002E4Z8M,Could this be used as a good mic for things like quality voice overs for YouTube videos and Lets Plays?,"It's one of the best.

Musical_Instruments,B0002E51ZS,Where is this pedal made?,It's made in the USA.
Musical_Instruments,B0002E51ZS,does the ac adapter come with it,MXR along with just about every effects pedal company does not include an AC adapter with their pedals. One can find package deals though that do include an AC adapter. If you happen to have one for a Boss effect pedal that will work; as well along with many other brands. Do note that these pedals come with a battery inside. It is important that you remove it if you don't plan to use it. Folks sometimes forget it is in there and the battery acid will erode the inner electronics of the pedal.
Musical_Instruments,B0002E51ZS,does the ac adapter come with it,"Nope. But any standard 9V DC adapter can power it. The pedal requires just about 10-15mA of current so a standard 200mA 9V DC adapter will do the job, or any multi effect powering unit/brick as well."
Musical_Instruments,B0002E51ZS,Does this pedal add a lot of noise to your signal?,"Not at all. However, it depends on your chain. Been playing nearly forty years and everybody is an expert on chain sequence. Just play with it. Compression is great but like anything else on a board you have to tweek a lot."
Musical_Instruments,B0002E51ZS,Does this pedal add a lot of noise to your signal?,Not a lot but it does boost noise you may already have from pickups or whatever.
Musical_Instruments,B0002E51ZS,Where is this pedal made?,"There's nothing on the case which is a very solid painted metal. Inside, on the printed circuit board it has Beneficia Ca 94510 USA."

Musical_Instruments,B0002F79CU,Will this case work for a 1/4 child's guitar?,"It's a small case, but it might still be a bit large for a 1/4 children's guitar? But to get a smaller case, you might have to look at larger ukulele cases, baritone being larger than tenor..."
Musical_Instruments,B0002F79CU,"Is this the SKB Baby Taylor/Martin LX Guitar Shaped Hardshell model that has the TSA type lock and if so, is it acceptable by all the airlines?","If you want TSA type lock, then forget about SKB Baby Taylor."

Musical_Instruments,B0002GZKWU,how does one connect this mic to a computer?,"If you want just to make the sound come out of your pc speakers, get a cable that fits mic and you computer's input. If you want to record, buy an interface like mobilepre, from maudio, and a cable that matches each input. It is pretty easy to use. Good luck."
Musical_Instruments,B0002GZKWU,"If one put this mic on a desk stand, would it pick you up good sitting up without having to lean in to it? (think johnny carson or david letterman)",AbsolutlyYou would need your gain set properly off of your mixing consoleMark
Musical_Instruments,B0002GZKWU,"If one put this mic on a desk stand, would it pick you up good sitting up without having to lean in to it? (think johnny carson or david letterman)","you would need to lean in to it. this mic is a low impedance unit.  if you are going to rest your arms on the desk put the mic close to one of your elbows, or between your hand and your elbow. that distance would be good. any further than that would be ""off Mike""."
Musical_Instruments,B0002GZKWU,"If one put this mic on a desk stand, would it pick you up good sitting up without having to lean in to it? (think johnny carson or david letterman)","This would not be good to put on a desk... It would require to turn the gain up on a mixer which would distort your sound. You'd be better off with a different style of mic, maybe a condenser mic, for that purpose."
Musical_Instruments,B0002GZKWU,do you send it with or without the bill of the mic?,If you order online you get a copy of your packing slip and your account has the ability to print out a copy of your bill.

Light gauge is .12-.53.  The custom light gauge is easier on the fingers, but not quite as loud as the light gauge.  You won't notice too much of a difference in loudness unless you fingerpick a lot.  Hope this helps!!"

Musical_Instruments,B0002KZQ34,Can you play Speed metal or Thrash on this amp.,"Yeah just put the distortion really high up.

Musical_Instruments,B000GFCYPS,"does it display the register of the note? for example it displays   c4, g5, e7 instead of just c, g, e","Yes, it's will display e3, g5"
Musical_Instruments,B000GFCYPS,Is there any reason this couldn't be used as a vocal tuner (alto through bass)?Thanks a lot!,"If you use it as a reference sound it produces a ""metallic"" timbre that might be dificult to match with the voice, but as a calibration it can do the job though its sensitivity decreases from C2 to C1"
Musical_Instruments,B000GFCYPS,Has anyone had any success with using this device to tune a piano?,"Not a good idea. The tuner doesn't respond to any of lowest 15 white and black keys below C2, which is two octaves below C4 (middle C)."
Musical_Instruments,B000GFCYPS,Does it offer a just intonation setting under the additional temperament presets?,"Pytagorean intonation ist just, but don't attempt to tune your piano with it!"
Musical_Instruments,B000GT88JA,Can it fit a left handed 5 string bass?,"This is not a molded case, so it should work just fine for a lefty or righty 5 string bass."
Musical_Instruments,B000H2BC4E,What kind of power cable does this use?,It uses a 12 volt DC power adapter. Included with unit.
Musical_Instruments,B000H2BC4E,What kind of power cable does this use?,It plugs into a regular electrical outlet.
Musical_Instruments,B000H2BC4E,What kind of power cable does this use?,it is a 110V  detachable plug/cable
Musical_Instruments,B000H2BC4E,"Can the RIAA equalization be switched off?  For playing LPs, you'd always want it, but for playing 78s for example you do *not* want it.","No.  There is no switch for ""On-Off"" function.  You can pull the plug to turn it off."
Musical_Instruments,B000H2BC4E,Is there a difference between a microphono and phono preamp?,Yes. Phono preamps have a specific equalization curve applied. There are also differences in the amount of amplification needed and probably the input impedance.
Musical_Instruments,B000H2BC4E,Is there a difference between a microphono and phono preamp?,"Yes, and the difference can be significant. Phono signal levels are extremely low and require a lot of boost. To complicate further, mic levels vary depending on the type of microphone. In this case, the ""micro"" in the ""microphone"" part of the name refers to size, not whether it works with microphones."
Musical_Instruments,B000J0N5TY,Will this hold the Blue Yeti?,The blue yeti package shows that it has a standard mic stand mount thread so it should once you remove its original stand
Musical_Instruments,B000J0N5TY,Will this hold the Blue Yeti?,"Yes, most definitely."
Musical_Instruments,B000J0N5TY,Can this be used with the samson go mic -mini usb?,"You could clamp that mic to the stand, but it's really made for standard , full size mic clips.  that use a standard  5/8"" thread."
Musical_Instruments,B000J0N5TY,Do i need an adaptor in order to use it with the blue Yeti?,Just take your Blue Yeti out of its stand and screw it in and you will be set to go! Nothing additional needed.
Musical_Instruments,B000J0N5TY,"Can someone who has this stand and the Yeti, confirm whether or not the Yeti can be attached directly to the stand (ie: no shock mount, etc)?","Yes, the Yeti can be attached directly to the mount with no other accessory."
Musical_Instruments,B000J0N5TY,Does it come with a Mount Microphone Clip,If you are talking about a clip that you screw on to the end to slide a microphone in then no it doesn't sadly. Only the spot to screw on a clip or screw on your mic
Musical_Instruments,B000J5Y282,Can you  use the Equalizer that is on Mono mike inputs on sterio inputs 5/6 thu 11/12. (Xenyx 802 has Equalizer usage on sterio inputs 3/4 5/6),The Behringer 1202 mixer does not have equalizers on the stereo inputs.  It only has them on the mic inputs.  Most anything that you will use with this mixer on the stereo inputs will have its own equalizer.  The mic inputs have a three band equalizer.
Musical_Instruments,B000J5Y282,Can you  use the Equalizer that is on Mono mike inputs on sterio inputs 5/6 thu 11/12. (Xenyx 802 has Equalizer usage on sterio inputs 3/4 5/6),Yes... although it is not as comprehensive as on the on the other channels.
Musical_Instruments,B000J5Y282,How many channels can be used at the same time? Planning to use with 7 mics for recording drums. Thanks.,"The Behringer has 12 inputs, but 4 are stereo line and 4 are mic.  You can use all 8 at the same time as stereo, or if you wanted, you can use some instruments on the left channel and some on the right channel to get all 12 inputs.You mention that you want 7 mics, however, this mixer can only do 4 mics.  If you had a second mixer, you could chain the two to get more than 4 mics."
Musical_Instruments,B000J5Y282,Is this actually a powered mixer?,"It is powered (comes with it's own AC adapter), and can provide phantom power to channels 1 through 4 (the 4 channels that have XLR inputs) The only downside is that there is only one button for phantom that turns it on for all 4 channels."
Musical_Instruments,B000J5Y282,Is this actually a powered mixer?,"It's not powered, you need to use a powered speaker"
Musical_Instruments,B000KIHCB2,Does it come with a music book for the xylophone?,It comes with a little card with five or six songs on it.
Musical_Instruments,B000KIHCB2,How big is that drum?,"it is about 4"" diameter, more like a tambourine. It has little beads inside it so when you shake it it makes a noise too. Not very loud. You would tap the underside to make it the drum"
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,does it come with the extender cord? compatible with M-Audio fast track - cord from the existing headphone jack to amp?,"To clarify further, it does NOT come with a cord as stated. What you would want to buy is a 1/4"" 'TRS' cord to connect from the Fast Track's headphone jack to the input of this headphone amp. These are available on Amazon as well. If you use a regular 1/4"" instrument cable, you lose stereo. TRS sends both right and left signals."
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,does it come with the extender cord? compatible with M-Audio fast track - cord from the existing headphone jack to amp?,"No, it only comes with the 12v adapter"
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,"Does this just split the audio, or does it actually ""drive"" headphones?  If so, how many Ohms can it handle?","It doesn't drive them as much as i want, but it does amplify. Impedance of cans will vary how much amp you hear. Cmoy amp is better imho..."
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,"The headphone/input jacks are 1/4"" stereo jacks, correct? That seems to be answered tangentially by another question, but just to make it clear.",Yes all inputs and output are 1/4. You will need 1/4 to 1/8 adapter for most consumer headphones.
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,"The headphone/input jacks are 1/4"" stereo jacks, correct? That seems to be answered tangentially by another question, but just to make it clear.","Yep, all 5 ports (1 input and 4 output) are 1/4"" stereo."
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,Does its power adapter work with 220 Volts? Or it is just 110? Thanks.,110 unless you get an adapter.
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,Will the input drive a microphone (stereo and/or mono) ???,"The input requires a line level signal, so this would not be possible."
Musical_Instruments,B000KIPT30,Will the input drive a microphone (stereo and/or mono) ???,"Sorry sir, this device has no connection to a microphone, this is a headphone amplifier, and splitter, the input is only one for a signal that comes from the headphone output from whether a mixer or a eegular amplifier, and you have the capability to conect up to 4 people/headphones with enough volume for each one. If yu connect a wired mic at the input the signal is too low that will be impossible to be amplified enough to the level to hear it, unless the signal comes from a mixer in which the mic is connected."

Musical_Instruments,B000O56IC0,"Did you have to bring the instrument in for initial adjustments (set the bridge, etc) or did you just play it out of the box?",The bridge and strings had to be replaced as they were useless. The pegs had to be refit to stay in tune. It cost over $100 to make useable.

Musical_Instruments,B000OQI2CI,"Does it need a special kind of strings?, or can be regular standard strings.",Just your standard steel acoustic strings work perfect.
Musical_Instruments,B000OQI2CI,What is the best batt powered amp go with this guitar???,"The Dean stack in a box is the best with your own high quality earbuds with volume control,  otherwise any full size amp. Awesome guitar though get one."
Musical_Instruments,B000OQI2CI,Can you replace the string with nylon?,Look at http://www.travelerguitar.com   In the last few years they added a Nylon model.  But you still need an amp ...so check out their true acoustic models such as the Acoustic-105 and Acoustic-200.

Musical_Instruments,B000P5LWWA,What is the length and the height of this saddle ?Thanks !,Tusq saddles come in various sizes. It's best to measure your existing saddle and then order one that is slightly larger. That way you can sand it down for a good fit. Hope this will be helpful!
Musical_Instruments,B000P5LWWA,It would be very nice to list dimensions in milimiters. What are the dimensions?,"Measure	 Length	Width Height E to E  inches2.908"" 0.101"" 0.383""	NA inches	2 29/32""3/32""	3/8""	NAmillimeters	73.86mm	2.57mm	9.73mm"
Musical_Instruments,B000P5LWWA,It would be very nice to list dimensions in milimiters. What are the dimensions?,Convert. Multiply inches (in decimals) by 25.4 to get millimeters.

Musical_Instruments,B000RN53LQ,Could this be used with a clip on acoustic pickup (eg HDE)  and with a small portable speaker?,No. There is not enough power output to drive a speaker. You might get some sound but it would sound terrible.  You need an amplifier.
Musical_Instruments,B000RN53LQ,Could this be used with a clip on acoustic pickup (eg HDE)  and with a small portable speaker?,Yes it can. But the speaker would have to be powered.
Musical_Instruments,B000RN53LQ,Can this be powered by the USB plug in to the computer?,No it cannot. It can only be powered by batteries or power adapter.
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Do these effect the quality of the sound in any way?,"Yes, of course.  It also depends on the skins.  If you have a high quality drum set, the sound will differ.  However, the quality of the sound is based solely on the rhythm of the drummer.  All the Vic Firth Kit does is muffle sounds."
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Do these effect the quality of the sound in any way?,"Yes, it dulls the sound with no sustain. Snare not as much because the chain is not muted underneath.  But still effective."
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,"How do you attach the 22"" bass drum pad?  Velcro, tape or some other mechanism?  Can you estimate how much these pads dampen the sound?  Thanks.",Yeah there is a velcro to attach it with the bass drum. And it is very effective! If you keep your drums in a room and close the door the drums won't be audible to anyone in the other rooms! But they may be able to listen to tapping caused on the bass drum. And i am really glad it is able to mute the cymbals completely!! You should buy them !
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Does it come with 2 for the hi-hats (1 for top and bottom)? Or do the hats have to stay closed the whole time for it to work?,It comes with one pad for the hi-hat that sits on the top hi-hat cymbal.

Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Are these actual drums ?,No just covers that sit on top of your Tom's and cymbal
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Are these actual drums ?,"No.  They are practice rubber pads that mute the sound of the drums and cymbals,  so you can remain friends with your neighborhood."
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Are these actual drums ?,The actual product are the black rubber pads shown on the cymbals and drum heads. These do a great job of deadening the sound when struck.
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,is this a complete drum set,"No,  these are just a pad for dampening the sounds of you drum kit,  so you can practice muted."
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,Can people in the next room bear the sound?,"Yes, they will be able to hear it ! But it will not be annoying.."
Musical_Instruments,B000SSMJG2,What size cymbals do the cymbal mutes fit?,The size doesn't really matter as it just dampens the reverberation
Musical_Instruments,B000UJEGT2,Is the kick drum pad wide enough to use a double-kick pedal?,Yes it is. Your left pedal is going to need something to stick to like carpet.
Musical_Instruments,B000UJEGT2,Is the kick drum pad wide enough to use a double-kick pedal?,"It's designed to be, but of course it depends on your particular 'span'. If you zoom in on the picture, you can see how it looks."

Musical_Instruments,B000VTPR08,It doesn't show the back side. Does the shoulder straps mean it can be carried like a backpack?,"Hi Frank... Yes it has the backpack configuration. As a matter of fact, it can be configured to carry high up on the back or lower since it has detach hooks. Also on the back is a separate loop for hanging on wall hooks etc. There is also a small clear window in which you can slide in a business card size name tag with all your pertinent info. That's about all that's on the back."
Musical_Instruments,B000VTPR08,Does this bag fit a Fender Kingman Acoustic (dreadnought) Bass Guitar?,"A bass guitar probable wont fit it.Plus there would be way to much space where the body of the guitar is located in the case, causing your bass to be subject to flying around all on the inside of the case."
Musical_Instruments,B000VTPR08,Does this bag fit a Fender Kingman Acoustic (dreadnought) Bass Guitar?,this bag was purchased to fit a full size Fender (dreadnought) Guitar.
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,Can this unit be used for harmonica playing also,Any overdrive pedal can be used to create an overdrive sound to a harmonica mic provided it's wired for a high impedance 1/4 phone jack. It should be noted that any mic used with overdrives or overdriven amps are more prone to feedback.
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,Noise gate only diffeerence between this and vt911?,"The 911 just has a simple tone control, vs. the 3-band controls on the Monster..."
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,"""true bypass"" add a clean tube phase(like a tube screamer with low gain) that reduces volume when not activate.Anyone else have this problem?","What M. Olsen said. The Gain and Master Volume are going to add ""volume"" (Gain, loudness) to the signal chain. So there will be a noticeable difference between the two especially if you like the way your amp responds to overdriving the amp's preamp tube with the Master control. You could increase the gain and lower the Volume setting on the pedal but you'll be getting your distortion from the pedal's preamp tube, not the amp's. You might like it, might not."
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,so does it come stock with the ac power supply or?,The power is sold separately.  It does operate on batteries.
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,so does it come stock with the ac power supply or?,"Under product description on the ad you can look in the ""What's in the Box"" section, and it will tell you exactly what you will be receiving."
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,How to connect it on a full tube amp (to get a differente tone) ? Should it be connected on return (loop) or directly on guitar input ?,"The input. The effects loop usually has some pre amplification, often by op amp, which can water down the tube sound. Its certainly possible to put it in the loop, but you may push the VTM a little harder than they are designed to be, which can (under certain conditions) shorten life span."
Musical_Instruments,B000W00X1Y,How to connect it on a full tube amp (to get a differente tone) ? Should it be connected on return (loop) or directly on guitar input ?,"Directly to the input jack, it is not a preamp. Cheerz."

It has built in preamp for mic and has instrument inputs also. It doesn't have a USB or FireWire for recording to a computer. This would require an audio interface to communicate with a computer (CPU).
Musical_Instruments,B000ZLV5O4,Where does the battery go?  Somewhere in the mic shell?,"Yeah, you unscrew the mic body, slide apart the two sections, and there's a compartment for the battery."

It's a selling point and clearly indicated as a feature in the product description.  People who are claiming the product is defective because channels 1&2 are louder, don't seem to realize this."
Musical_Instruments,B0027B41P0,"for channels 9/10 it says something like ""2 track"" what is the deal with that? basically what im saying is can i use it like a normal channel?",Most mixers are limited to having stereo channels this would give you the ability to have one extra stereo channel and also a eq for all the channels
Musical_Instruments,B0027B41P0,"for channels 9/10 it says something like ""2 track"" what is the deal with that? basically what im saying is can i use it like a normal channel?","It's a channel where you can use one or the other input (mic vs. line-in for example).  On a 10-channel mixer, you don't really have 10 full channels.  Go by the number of sliders you see for the number of things you can operate and mix at the same time.  Most will be just for mics.  But the last one or two usually have other inputs like line-in, so you can directly connect a CD player or such."

Musical_Instruments,B002GYWBKK,"Can i combine this with an epression pedal?

Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this improve the sound of the bass in anyway or is it just a cosmetic enhance?,"Its a cosmetic enhancement om humbucking pickups.  On jazz basses with single coil pickups it completes the shielding, if you have shielded underneath the pickups."
Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this improve the sound of the bass in anyway or is it just a cosmetic enhance?,"The pickup bridge is more than cosmetic as suggested by other answers. The idea by Fender, was to give a palm rest for playing.It does not enhance the sound of the bass at all. Your controls on the guitar and the quality of your amp settings does that."
Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this improve the sound of the bass in anyway or is it just a cosmetic enhance?,"when you first buy the guitar, most guitarists will remove the cover for more use of the length of the strings. it is a more gutsy treble solid sound as opposed to leaving the cover on. try it without cover and you can tell the difference. i could name a bunch of world class bassists i have seen in person with the bridge cover removed."
Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this improve the sound of the bass in anyway or is it just a cosmetic enhance?,"most likely sound effect is nill. as for the guy claiming ""noise shielding""..negitive on that unless it is a grounded cover which i have never seen. it is a palm rest for the obsolete motown style of play. looks cool though"
Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this work on a Fender Jazz bass (fretless) - thanks?,Thats the size of any fender jazz bass
Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this work on a Fender Jazz bass (fretless) - thanks?,"Yes, but you will need to screw/drill holes for the mounting cover into your bass and through the pick guard."
Musical_Instruments,B002HF483G,Will this work on a Fender Jazz bass (fretless) - thanks?,"Certainly, it is for the Fender Jazz bass. They were standard fitting back in the 60's. but no longer fitted on later models. You will have to position it carefully  over the pickup before screwing it down.  Being a fretless bass, does not come into it at all."

Musical_Instruments,B003BLOSA8,Will this work as a carry-on for flights or does it need to be checked in? Thanks!,It is designed to be a check in. You wouldn't need this kind of case for a carry on you would just use your regular case. Sometimes the airlines let them on and sometimes that don't!

Musical_Instruments,B003V34WKC,"Does it come with a 12V DC adapter for powering the unit externally, or does that have to be purchased separately? If so, what would you recommend?","Hey Nick,It only comes with a USB cable to plug into your computer. That's all the power it needs, since it's only a midi controller, not your usual keyboard. Hope this helps!Steve."
Musical_Instruments,B003V34WKC,"Does it come with a 12V DC adapter for powering the unit externally, or does that have to be purchased separately?

Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,"Are the cables - center + outer collar or vice versa? Also, for the output plugs what diameter(s) are provided? Thanks!","The chamaleon comes with a bunch of cables in different +/- input-output and different colors to use it with pedals with positive center, or reverse polarity, etc.About the output plugs, i don´t know exactly what you mean, but there is a couple cables with the size of the tube screamer input, which is smaller and different."
Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,"Are the cables - center + outer collar or vice versa? Also, for the output plugs what diameter(s) are provided? Thanks!","Chameleon's outputs are negative in center. It doesn't come with a reversible cable. All outputs are 2.1mm, and most of supplied cables have 2.1mm plugs. Also has a 2.5mm cable (type AC 12V) and a 3.5mm (type Tube Screamer)."
Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,"Are the cables - center + outer collar or vice versa? Also, for the output plugs what diameter(s) are provided? Thanks!",Hello. Have a look st the Trex website or contact them directly.  But all cables are centre negative. The plugs are the standard 2.1mm type plus one to power a dunlopmlp wah
Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,Is there an advantage to a guitar affects power supply versus just a good power strip and typical 9V power adapters?,"No advantage really. As long as your adapters work fine the only advantage that a single supply has is space on your pedal board. Also if you are moving your pedal board a lot, power adapters can fall out of the power strip. If you only have one or two power adapters, stay with that solution."
Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,Can you use the right angle side of the supplied cables on the pedal and the straight side on the power supply or are they one way only?,"Yes, of course you can, the angled side is made like that so when you plug it to you pedals it wont disturb your pedalboard space. But you can plug boths sides to the power supply... there's no 1-way cable in the box."
Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,Can you use the right angle side of the supplied cables on the pedal and the straight side on the power supply or are they one way only?,All the cables i got had only right angles it shouldnt matter which way they go on. The current will flow so long as there is a completed circuit.
Musical_Instruments,B003Y3ASW0,Can you use the right angle side of the supplied cables on the pedal and the straight side on the power supply or are they one way only?,There isn't a cable with right angle plug on one side and straight plug on the other side. All supplied cables have right angle plugs. The only straight plug is on the daisy chain cable.

Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does it sound good played both acoustically and amplified?,"It sounds very good acoustically for a thin-line guitar. Since it has a thin body, you wont get the deep bass sound that you get from a standard size acoustic guitar. Plugged in directly to an amp it doesn't sound that great, however, you can get a very nice amplified sound by either: 1) installing an ACTIVE pickup that you can find online for around ten bucks, or 2) playing through an effects pedal that has EQ, Chorus, etc. An effects pedal gives you more control of the sound."
Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does this have Active Electronics?,"No, this guitar has ""passive"" electronics.. There are only two slider switches for the pickup, master volume , and a master tone .. It's passive because there are no batteries required, there is no ""pre-amp"" .. Very simple , when plugged into your amp that's all you get, it sounds great with the E,A,D,and G strings when your playing... However the tone for the B,and high E strings is very very weak ..even when your tone switch is maxed out on the guitar... Over all it's good for what is is... Hope this helps !"
Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does this have Active Electronics?,"Not exactly sure what you mean by ""active electronics"", but an internal pick-up allows for amplified sound, and volume and tone controls allow you to take it from there"
Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does this have Active Electronics?,"NO, passive pick up only"

Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does it comes with a strap bolt at the neck?,"Hi! The guitar is designed to have just the one strap button. For proper balance, the other end of the strap is supposed to tie behind the nut. Thanks!"
Musical_Instruments,B003YVRGN6,Does it comes with a strap bolt at the neck?,"Hi!  You tie the other end behind the nut under the strings on the headstock. This is the best balance. If you prefer, you can install a strap button on the heal of the guitar (it is simple to do).  Just contact MDW Support with your order info and they can send one right out. But the tie method is usually the best."
Musical_Instruments,B0040WWUYS,"Hi, this pin schaller fit neatly into a PRS 245?","you may want to inquire of PRS if they would fit neatly. They are somewhat generic so it may not be a ""perfect"" fit.....cd"
Musical_Instruments,B0041OSWX8,What kind of end is the usb cable?,The mobile Pre has a USB type B connector (the kind often used on printers). http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/usb The other end is a normal Type-A (the kind on most computers.)

Musical_Instruments,B0042EZH6W,Does this amp works with any electric guitar or not?,"Yes, the amp works with any electric guitar.  If you're using an acoustic with a pickup on it, it won't sound exactly like an acoustic, but it will be close.  If you plug a bass guitar into it, you should not turn it up very loud or you could damage the speaker.  It isn't made for low bass notes or use with a bass guitar."
Musical_Instruments,B0042EZH6W,can you plug in an acoustic guitar?,"You can plug in anything that uses 1/4 mono instrument cable (an electric guitar cable). That includes most acoustics with a pickup. Just be aware that this amp is made to color the sound, so if you want an ""acoustic"" sound, you're better off with a amp built for acoustics."
Musical_Instruments,B0042EZH6W,can you plug in an acoustic guitar?,"if it has a pickup or a microphone, yes."
Musical_Instruments,B0042EZH6W,can you plug in an acoustic guitar?,"Yes, if it has a pickup, you can."
Musical_Instruments,B0042EZH6W,can you plug in an acoustic guitar?,"You can plug an electro-acoustic guitar, yes."
Musical_Instruments,B0042EZH6W,mic input? Can you use a mic with this amp?,"Yes.  Most mics use an XLR connector.  Guitar amps use ¼ inch so you need a cable that is XLR to 1/4 inch or an additional XLR to 1/4"" adapter...which you can find for about $5-$10 on Amazon."
Musical_Instruments,B0042Z3ADI,"How is the audio quality, compared with Focusrite gear in the same price range (e.g., Scarlett 2i2)?","Its surprisingly high quality, they are very similar."

Musical_Instruments,B0042Z3ADI,Can you record the tracks separately and then play the recorded track and record a second or third track ( Iam a one man band ),"Akai EIE is not a multitrack recorder. It is a audio interface that connects to a IOS device, like ipad or a PC."
Musical_Instruments,B0042Z3ADI,Can you record the tracks separately and then play the recorded track and record a second or third track ( Iam a one man band ),That's all up to your software.  The Akai is just an interface to get your sound to your computer.

Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,"Can you change pitch, or only speed?",You can change both with separate controls
Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,"Does it remove original guitar track during slower-speed playback, or is the point to play over original guitar track so you can hear it better?",What Scott Parker said.
Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,How do you store the songs you recorded using the divice on your computer?,Connect the trainer to your computer and it will ask you if you are connecting to use the USB as a power supply for the trainer or as a storage device; select storage device.  Once you connect that way you can move files back and forth between the trainer and your computer.
Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,How do you store the songs you recorded using the divice on your computer?,"Yep pretty darn easy, connect to your computer via supplied USB cable.  That's how you load your mp3s on and off as well as the WAV files you record."
Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,"How is powered this Tascam Guitar Trainer¿Batteries,Usb or AC adapter?",The GB-10 can be powered from batteries or an AC adapter from TASCAM specifically for this Trainer.

Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,"How is powered this Tascam Guitar Trainer¿Batteries,Usb or AC adapter?","The Tascam PSP520 AC adapter is gross overkill (ampacity-wise) for the GB-10.  It's expensive, large, and poorly filtered (EMI-wise).  The latter will be obvious if your guitar or bass is an inexpensive starter model without cavity shielding.  A cell phone charger will suffice.  The Apple iPhone charger, although pricier than others, is dead-quiet."
Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,Will this work with an acoustic guitar or will guitar need a pick up?,"It needs a pick up,  it doesn't have a microphone."
Musical_Instruments,B00452V2S8,Will this work with an acoustic guitar or will guitar need a pick up?,You need a guitar with a pick up to use this excellent product.

Musical_Instruments,B00466HLXI,Does it work with 32 bit computer?,"Yes, if your have midi software that is 32 bit, no problem.  Plug into the USB port and you are off to the races!  If you are new to midi recording also, make sure to download the free ""Ignite"" software that came with the keyboard.

Musical_Instruments,B005M1U7GO,"does anyone kmow why it would not duplicate a cd  it says not enough room for all data,why?",You have to make sure that you are using the correct cd. The cds that you use to record music are different from the ones that you use to record movies. If you try to put a movie on a disc that you use to record music there will not be enough room on the disc.
Musical_Instruments,B005M1U7GO,"does anyone kmow why it would not duplicate a cd  it says not enough room for all data,why?",The CD was probably originally filled up completely to the end with data. Then the computer put a little bit of identifying information on the end. So it has actually exceeded the limit that the CD would normally hold.

Musical_Instruments,B00723435G,is true by pass ?,"No it is not true bypass. In general, you do not want a delay with true bypass. A delay with true bypass will cut the delays as soon as you turn the effect off. The ones with a buffered bypass will keep the delay going until the delay ends... For example, say you have a quarter delay that repeats 5 times. With a true bypass pedal, you play a note and it repeats, and as soon as you turn off the pedal, the repeats will stop. With. Buffered one, when you turn off the pedal, the delay will keep going and repeat 4 times."

If you're using an unpowered USB hub (or if your USB port can't power the interface, which is a rare case), you'll need an AC/DC adapter for the interface, which is not included."
Musical_Instruments,B007VQIBB6,"How do you set this keyboard with OSX 10.9? MIDI setup shows no KORG and no app works with it, beside the apps included with the purchase.","No setup is necessary for those who use OS X. You plug in the USB cable and you are all set. It is the advantage of class-compliant USB MIDI devices. If in doubt, try it with GarageBand, which is included in your Mac OS X. If you are talking about customizing the control number or arpeggiator, use KORG KONTROL Editor."
Musical_Instruments,B007VQIBB6,Is this of plastic build? Thank you!,"Yes it is, but it seems pretty sturdy"
Musical_Instruments,B007VQIBB6,Is this of plastic build? Thank you!,"Yes it is. It feels pretty good nonetheless, for a mini controller. But it is inexpensive and does not feel like a more expensive, higher quality controller."

Musical_Instruments,B007VQIBB6,does it have a headphone input,"No, it does not have a headphone out. But since you must play it into a computer, one simply connects headphones to the device with same result."
Musical_Instruments,B007VQIBB6,can i learn to play scales and songs on this without downloading the software?,"this is a midi controller, you have to plug it into a computer and run the software to get it to make sound."
Musical_Instruments,B007VQIBB6,can i learn to play scales and songs on this without downloading the software?,"The software is just audio ""soft-synths.""  The keyboard itself is plug-and-play, so it should work just fine for scales.  Just keep in mind, it's a tiny keyboard, so scales might not be too natural-feeling.  It's mainly for small/mobile laptop studio production."
Musical_Instruments,B0080GZLU0,how many speakers can be pluged in an daisy chained off this amp,"It goes up to 2 ohms, so 3 8 ohms speakers per channel but stay within the ohm wattage per 8, 4, & 2 ohm load."
Musical_Instruments,B0080GZLU0,Serve for two drawers 2 x 15 '' 1000 watts each?,"If you want to push that much power you'll most likely want something larger as this is 1000the watts peak. More headroom would be better, unless you aren't planning/desiring to push them very hard."
Musical_Instruments,B0080GZLU0,Serve for two drawers 2 x 15 '' 1000 watts each?,Could you be a little more specific with this partial question?
Musical_Instruments,B008277N80,"Looking for a decent Uke for an adult to learn to play.  Is this a toy, or would it be a decent beginner instrument for a 20-something adult?","It's junk.  Won't hold a tuning, so as an instrument on which to learn it would be particularly awful."
Musical_Instruments,B008277N80,"Looking for a decent Uke for an adult to learn to play.  Is this a toy, or would it be a decent beginner instrument for a 20-something adult?","Not a toy! Definitely works well, and the strings can be changed to become a real instrument past the learning phase"
Musical_Instruments,B008277N80,"Looking for a decent Uke for an adult to learn to play.  Is this a toy, or would it be a decent beginner instrument for a 20-something adult?","Old question but YES that is the point of this one, a beginner uke to see if you like it or not...and for a beginner uke it's certain of higher quality than many comparable ones.  It's not meant to last you 10 years it's meant to give you an idea if you'd want to invest in a really nice one."
Musical_Instruments,B008277N80,Is this just painted? Is this a real kit you can finish?,its a ukulele with a black case but not a hard case its like a bag
Musical_Instruments,B008277N80,DOES IT COME WITH STRINGS?,"Yes it comes with strings, and a case. But the case is soft, and kind of cheap looking."
Musical_Instruments,B008277N80,"Is the finish stained, as claimed (can you see the woodgrain), or painted brown?   It looks like if it's stained, that it's a dull finish.  TIA.",It wasn't wood. More like some kind of molded resin material.

Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this mount come and be able to be used on a Blue Yeti without having to buy any sort of extra adapters or cables?,The cable that is built into this mount is not USB.  It is an XLR cable and would not connect to the Blue Yeti USB mic.
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this mount come and be able to be used on a Blue Yeti without having to buy any sort of extra adapters or cables?,This is for an XLR type of microphone not a USB type like the Blue Yeti. You will have to fond an arm stand specifically for USB or just generic and get a longer USB cable. Hope this helps!
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this mount come and be able to be used on a Blue Yeti without having to buy any sort of extra adapters or cables?,No. You will also need to buy the shock mount that blue makes for the yeti as the yeti is much larger than a normal microphone.
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will the shock mount hold an Apogee mic?,"It would but since the Apogee mic is USB this is probably not the arm you are looking for. Unless you remove the mic cable & somehow replace it with a long USB cable. Or, if you don't care how it looks, just ignore the mic cable & feed a USB cable on the outside of the arm. Hope this helps."
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this stand and shock mount hold an Audio Technica AT-2020?,Yeap! You will have to remove the microphone cord that comes with the shock mount to get the cable through the army but other than that its a FANTASTIC buy.
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this stand and shock mount hold an Audio Technica AT-2020?,Yes and for the prize is wonderful
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this hold a Blue snowball microphone?,The shock mount that this came with would it couldn't eve hold the yeti but if you get the one made for the mic it Will screw on very easy and hold the weight of it with out problems. This arm has proven to do its job with little to no troubles at all
Musical_Instruments,B0082918X4,Will this shock mount work with an ATR-2500?,Yes.I reviewed the ATR-2500 and should work well with it.I would definitely advise using a wind screen for best on air sound.
Musical_Instruments,B0082DAL3S,what kind of stand would i need for this?,A tripod or any stand with a wide base and a strong frame. Its heavy butbits effective.
Musical_Instruments,B0082DAL3S,what kind of stand would i need for this?,You need a standard mic stand.... it is built with a universal fitting...and there is an extender piece...that allows you to use one stand...one for the shield and the extender holds the mic. It also has rubber feet..if you have a table top mic...it can sit on a table.
Musical_Instruments,B0082DAL3S,is the mic included?,The microphone is not included.
Musical_Instruments,B0082DAL3S,is the mic included?,"Unfortunately, there is no microphone included in this package!"
Musical_Instruments,B0082DAL3S,Would the Blue Bluebird Microphone fit in it?,Yes... any recording mic will fit in it. Your shock mount attaches to it. It doesn't come with the shock mount or mic in the picture. They're only in the picture to show you how it looks assembled.

Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,Do You Need a Cab For The amp To Play? Ive Never Used and Orange :/,"This amp is solid state so *NO* you do *NOT* need a cab. Headphones will not sound as good, but you can use them without connecting the amp to a speaker. Only tube amps need a load."
Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,Do You Need a Cab For The amp To Play? Ive Never Used and Orange :/,"An amp head such as this one requires a cabinet. You could use headphones as an option, but you still may need to have a cabinet to ensure that there is a proper load on the amplifier."
Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,Do You Need a Cab For The amp To Play? Ive Never Used and Orange :/,"Because this amp's power stage is solid state, you can probably run it with no speaker load but CHECK THE MANUAL."
Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,Do You Need a Cab For The amp To Play? Ive Never Used and Orange :/,"Some confusion here in the answers. Garrett A. Hartzog is wrong. This amp only has a tube in the preamp stage. The power stage is solid state, so no cab (in which the speaker would generate the load) required. You say you never used an Orange amp, well, the brand has nothing to do with it. Most Orange amps are complete tube amps and those do need a cab, this one isn't and doesn't. That said, if you don't want to use a cab, you might as well use an amp modeler or computer based emulation. The point of this little thing is that it can actually drive a speaker and move some air."
Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,"If it's made in China, does it have that British Tone?","INGLÉSYes, it's made in china but it sounds great and definitely has that British tone."
Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,No effects loop? Has anyone put a reverb pedal in front of it? Did it sound OK doing so?,"i did, and it sounded terrible."
Musical_Instruments,B008BTTQI4,No effects loop? Has anyone put a reverb pedal in front of it? Did it sound OK doing so?,Effects sound ok if you run the amp clean. If you use the amp gain it gets too muddy. There is not much clean volume either so keep that in mind.
Musical_Instruments,B008GS3XLQ,"Does a 21"" ukulele fit perfectly in the 21"" case or is it too small ?",Is it a soprano uke though?
Musical_Instruments,B008GS3XLQ,Will a long neck soprano fit in this? It says 22.5 body length,There is a chart right at the top of this page. It could not be simpler. Just look up you uke's length. You have 3 choices in lengths.
Musical_Instruments,B008GS3XLQ,Will a long neck soprano fit in this? It says 22.5 body length,"Total is 22.5, a nice case"
Musical_Instruments,B008M4EJXA,Are these better than Powered by Lace pickups?,"Yes, those are the better  than Powered by Lace pickups, thanks --sofia"
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,Does this come with a case or anything? How do you carry it around?,"It does not come with a case, you would need to purchase one if you need to carry it around with you. The stand folds flat so it should be easy to carry."
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,Does this come with a case or anything? How do you carry it around?,Does not come with any sort of case.I don't carry it around. Just sits on the stand.
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,Does this come with a case or anything? How do you carry it around?,"It comes with a stand, headset, and manual."
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,Does this come with a case or anything? How do you carry it around?,"No, it does not come with a case. The stand folds for ease of travel. If you want/need to carry it around, you will have to purchase a case for it."
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,"The picture seems to show a monitor to display music from the cd, does it come with a monitor?",No - it needs to be connected to a computer
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,"The picture seems to show a monitor to display music from the cd, does it come with a monitor?",No. It doesn't come with a monitor.
Musical_Instruments,B008R7F31Y,Can the keyboard be fixed onto the stand? Or does the piano just sit on top?,Sits on top of the frame just fine made more secure by mounts on the frame that slide sideways to make more secure.  You would have to kick it over to knock it off.
Musical_Instruments,B0091NYFSU,Is this speaker as good as it is advertised? A little skeptical about the rms numbers because the top brands don't have that kind of rms numbers.,"No, real numbers are 150W rms."
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,how does the cover for the keyboard of the PX 850 work?,"About an inch above privia emblem you'll notice a gap approx 1/3"" wide (running length of keyboard), which your fingers can fit in and pull out.  You'll also notice grooves on either end of the piano that the cover will stay in as it pulls out.  Hope this helps"
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,how does the cover for the keyboard of the PX 850 work?,It just slides back into the body's and slides out over the keys like most pianos.
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,how does the cover for the keyboard of the PX 850 work?,The cover works on a simple slide mechanism. It is durable and looks nice. No complaints.
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Is this piano Made in Japan? Do this come with headphones and bench? What other accessories come with this? Thanks.,"China.  No bench, so subwoofer."
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Would this be a good choice for someone who is self teaching to play the piano at home?,"Yes, it is less expensive than a ""real"" piano, but feels and sounds pretty much the same, and it is also more compact. Being able to practice with headphones means that the learner can play without disturbing anyone. Being able to record and play back help to listen to one's own performance and better evaluate what needs to be improved, and one can also play one's own accompaniment!"
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Would this be a good choice for someone who is self teaching to play the piano at home?,"Yes it produces professional level sound and key touch, and an all important half pedal (gradual pedal action) for a professional level player."
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Would this be a good choice for someone who is self teaching to play the piano at home?,Sure.  It has a very good keyboard (a very true touch) and a nice sound.  It's a very good deal for the price.
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Can you remove the keyboard section from the stand or is it just one unit once put together?,U can't not remove it once it is put together unless you remove whole part unassemble. It is more like real piano than keyboard with stand.
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Can you remove the keyboard section from the stand or is it just one unit once put together?,"Once put together, it is one unit!"
Musical_Instruments,B0094D3L4Q,Can you remove the keyboard section from the stand or is it just one unit once put together?,It's one unit when assembled. The keyboard portion is very heavy and it wouldn't really be practical to lug around on its own. It's attached to the base with some screws and a cable (for the pedals). Also the speakers are suspended from the base of the keyboard - so it wouldn't actually sit flat on its own.
Musical_Instruments,B0094KNESM,Is there a stand included for your music book?,"Yes, there is a music stand that you can attach to the keyboard."
Musical_Instruments,B0094KNESM,Is there a stand included for your music book?,"Yes , There is."
Musical_Instruments,B0094KNESM,Is there a stand included for your music book?,"Hi,yes there is a stand where you can put your music book. But this stand is not easy, you need to have music book with wire-o binding otherwise pages closes"

Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Does it come with the locking nut?,Yes it does. The locking nut is included.
Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Does it come with the locking nut?,"Yes, it does. This particular floyd rose tremolo comes with everything that is shown in the picture"
Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Will it fit a Squire Fender Stratocaster?,Not unless you have a tech to router out some of the hole because there is a difference in the block size. Does not flush mount
Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Will it fit a Squire Fender Stratocaster?,It will so long as your strat already had a tremolo bridge. In which case you'll have to drill the holes for the posts of the floyd rose tremolo yourself. That's the only modification you'll be making to your guitar.
Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Will it fit a Squire Fender Stratocaster?,"To put it simply, no. It would require body work on the strat."
Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Will it fit a Squire Fender Stratocaster?,"Unless previously modified, a standard Fended Squire Stratocaster would require modifications at the nut and bridge. It can be done but should not be taken lightly. It takes some work. Rather than looking a Floyd for a Stratorcaster perhaps consider a Super-Vee: https://www.super-vee.com/products.html It does cost more but doesn't require modification."
Musical_Instruments,B0098DBIVK,Will it fit a Squire Fender Stratocaster?,not without routing out some wood at the existing bridge.
Musical_Instruments,B009AM3L78,where do you mount the pickup,Mount it under the saddle. You need to sand down the saddle's bottom and drill a hole thru the bridge under the saddle for pickup wire.
Musical_Instruments,B009AM3L78,where do you mount the pickup,"Pickup should be under the saddle. Just be aware this is a Martin ""like"" pre-amp package, it is not an original one.  For installation you can check some youtube videos. Good luck!"
Musical_Instruments,B009AM3L78,"i have a applause ae-28 by ovation it has a very basic pre amp and saddle pick up, will this work?","Yes.  But, whenever you use an under-saddle pick up, you will have to modify the bridge and adjust the action on your guitar.  If you do not have the knowledge, tools or skills to do that, you will need to take it to a luthier to get it done properly.  Also, you will have to cut a hole in the upper left hand bout of your guitar to fit the control.  These are not necessarily easy tasks.  Good luck."
Musical_Instruments,B009AM3L78,"i have a applause ae-28 by ovation it has a very basic pre amp and saddle pick up, will this work?",The worst case scenario is that you would have to enlarge the whole. Other that that it will work on any acoustic
Musical_Instruments,B009AM3L78,"i have a applause ae-28 by ovation it has a very basic pre amp and saddle pick up, will this work?","yes it will.....as long as your fairly handy,  there are alot of videos on youtube where you can see the proper way to cut out the whole on the side of the guitar, etc.  good luck"
Musical_Instruments,B009DV5NJ0,what are the dimensions of the top plate,"Hi,it is 9 inches by 9 inches.  Thanks"
Musical_Instruments,B009DV5NJ0,what are the dimensions of the top plate,"8 1/4"" x 11 3/4 ( a pair of 8.5"" X 12"" isopads will work nicely)"
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Is their a place to put a strap on it?,"it has one peg on the bottom, and your supposed to use the kind of strap that ties around the head at the top but i dont like those so i went to a music store and bout another peg (about 3 dollars) and then i just put it where it would normally go, u just screw it in. any guitar store will do it for u for like 5 bucks if you dont want to do it yourself. so in short yes there is a place to put the strap just not the normal one. but for the price of this guitar your not going to beat this deal it sounds good, and you can plug it into an amp if you need to."
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Is their a place to put a strap on it?,"There is a strap button on the bottom of the guitar, but you will need to tie the other end of the strap to the neck, above the nut"
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Is their a place to put a strap on it?,"Yes. There's a place at the butt of the guitar for one end of the strap, but you need a shoelace to tie the other end of the strap to the head. Works just fine."
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Can you use headphones with this?,"Yes, but you still need a headphone amp.  Also, you may need an adaptor depending on your headphones."
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Does is have a built in tuner?,No ... but if you have a smartphone there are quite a few free tuning apps.
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Does is have a built in tuner?,The short answer is NO.
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Does is have a built in tuner?,no it doesnt but is very easy to tune and stays in tune
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Does it stay in tune?,"mostly. i think putting new strings on would be better, but as a simple strumming mess-around acoustic, its a great buy."
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Does it stay in tune?,"yes it does, this is a really good guitar"
Musical_Instruments,B009FOY13O,Does it stay in tune?,after purchase You have to Tune it up Once or twice.

Musical_Instruments,B00EM5UOBE,"Do both the speakers play at once, can you play them both with the same sound and fxs? Or does on side of the amp play at a time","Both speakers work at the same time on all channels.  Side 1 is a clean amp with limited affects.  You have no control over the type of amp, you can add some affects like reverb ect.  Side two allows you to change the type of amp, Tweet, Blackface, British ect. along with more affects and alsol gain knob."
Musical_Instruments,B00EM5UOBE,Is channel 1 of this amp just a plain solid state with no digital emulation just like a 1980's solid state amp?,Its a clean channel. No FX's. You can however add FX's and amp tones to it if you want
Musical_Instruments,B00EM5UOBE,Is channel 1 of this amp just a plain solid state with no digital emulation just like a 1980's solid state amp?,"Channel 1 is like supposed to sound like a Fender Twin amp without gain or overdrive sounds. You can add Fx into channel 1 like wah, chorus, temelo, etc."
Musical_Instruments,B00EM5UOBE,Is channel 1 of this amp just a plain solid state with no digital emulation just like a 1980's solid state amp?,"No.  Channel one has an FX select knob to switch between 16 effects including wah-wah, vibratone, chorus, reverb, etc.  Channel 2 has same effects as channel one, but also has a knob for 16 different voice effects.  Channel two also has a Gain knob for overdrive.  Both 1 and 2 have separate FX level knobs.  The amp also comes with a foot switch to alternate between channels and effects.  It's a great amp.  Crank it up and it vibrates the walls and blows out the windows."
Musical_Instruments,B00EM5UOBE,Would this amp be good for some heavier rock like Black Sabbath or Metallica?,Answer here..yes.
Musical_Instruments,B00EM5UOBE,Would this amp be good for some heavier rock like Black Sabbath or Metallica?,"Yes this amp has a good distortion.

Musical_Instruments,B00EQDITGO,"Can someone get really basic. How is this thing set up, i presume it plugs into an amp and a guitar, but are two channels needed for stereo, etc.","Plug into amp, plug into guitar. It's super simple. You don't need to channels just two cables"
Musical_Instruments,B00EQDITGO,"Can someone get really basic. How is this thing set up, i presume it plugs into an amp and a guitar, but are two channels needed for stereo, etc.","Absolutely.  Guitar -> FX Pedals (if you have any) -> Mono (left) input on Jamman -> Mono (left) output on Jamman -> Amp.  The stereo is there if you ever end up running a stereo rig, but it works exactly the same in mono.  And the single button control is incredibly easy once you get the hang of it."
Musical_Instruments,B00EQDITGO,"Can someone get really basic. How is this thing set up, i presume it plugs into an amp and a guitar, but are two channels needed for stereo, etc.","Nope, two channels aren't needed.  Just a guitar, two cables, and an amp.  Run the guitar into the (mono) input with the first cable, run the (mono) output cable into the amp, and you're good to go!"
Musical_Instruments,B00EQDITGO,"Can someone get really basic. How is this thing set up, i presume it plugs into an amp and a guitar, but are two channels needed for stereo, etc.",Guitar or another effects pedal plugs into right side. The direction of the signal goes right to left for effects.
Musical_Instruments,B00EQDITGO,"Can someone get really basic. How is this thing set up, i presume it plugs into an amp and a guitar, but are two channels needed for stereo, etc.","Plug guitar into JamMan. Plug JamMan into amp. Play guitar, push button, record."
Musical_Instruments,B00EQDITGO,"Can someone get really basic. How is this thing set up, i presume it plugs into an amp and a guitar, but are two channels needed for stereo, etc.",Just use it as a mono rig.  Plug guitar into what effects you want and the JamMan the last in the chain.

Musical_Instruments,B00EYZMD16,How is it that the Kontrol S4 has higher ratings than the supposedly upgraded S8?  Is the S4 actually better?,Depends on what you're doing.

Musical_Instruments,B00EYZMD16,How is it that the Kontrol S4 has higher ratings than the supposedly upgraded S8?  Is the S4 actually better?,i think so cuz you can buy the d2s which is the s8 in a small version sorta like the x1 and use them with the s4 so you get the best of both worlds

Musical_Instruments,B00FX7MMRO,"Would it be ok to use these as regular computer speakers when not using for mixing, like to play net radio, or would that be bad for them?",Rock out!!!!Best solution would be to connect the computer into the mixer feeding the monitors then it is no different from any other source. If you are connecting directly to the computer headphone jack just be careful not to send too hot of a signal - if you hear any distortion at all then turn down the volume on the computer - and you will be fine.
Musical_Instruments,B00FX7MMRO,Are these monitors magnetically shielded?,The M-Audio 40's are!

Musical_Instruments,B00GXH4XVQ,How to connect the es100 to an external amp,"2 1/4"" headphones jacks - not ideal but it works. Problem is that when plugged in to headphone jack the onboard speakers are disabled, so you need a monitor for you"
Musical_Instruments,B00GXH4XVQ,How to connect the es100 to an external amp,It has two 1/4 jack outputs (L/R) which allows 1/4 connection to an external amp.
Musical_Instruments,B00GXH4XVQ,what is the polyphony?,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony  also has a good definition.
Musical_Instruments,B00GXH4XVQ,what is the polyphony?,"""In music, polyphony is a texture consisting of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody, as opposed to music with just one voice (monophony) or music with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords""What this means is that the keyboard is able to have more than one sound at the same time."
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,What is this for?  Improving sound quality?,"When you talk, tiny particles of saliva can come out. If these get into a microphone, it can make a ""pop"" sound. It helps stop that from happening, and seems to do a fairly good job if it's positioned right. Though this particular one was a bit hard to attach."
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,What is this for?  Improving sound quality?,"It will reduce the effects of ""popping""  due to your voice hitting the microphone.  It will reduce the impact making it much clearer"
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,What is this for?  Improving sound quality?,It's so you don't get a lot of feedback when you are using the mic and also isn't good to use a mic without it.
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Can you mount this microphone on a boom stand or scissor boom stand?,"Hi there. If you have a flat-sided/square arm on your stand then this filter will clamp on to it. If the components are tubular rather than rectangular/square, then the other Auphonix pop filter would be a better fit.  (http://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Auphonix-Environment-Accessories-Positioning/dp/B00CFXH4S6/)"
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Can you mount this microphone on a boom stand or scissor boom stand?,"The filter needs even surfaces, and the Yeti is curved, falls off all the time."
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Is the pop filter alone enough or should this be combined with anything else such as a foam or cloth screen over the end of the microphone?,The pop filter is sufficient enough. The foam mostly protects from dirt/debris/condensation. So depending on the environment you will use the Yeti in will determine whether you need the foam over the microphone.
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Is the pop filter alone enough or should this be combined with anything else such as a foam or cloth screen over the end of the microphone?,"It really depends on the talent and the distance you have the filter from the mike, but it does it a pretty good job.  Having said that, it's also fairly thin (by design), so if you have a lot of pickup or your talent is particularly breathy, you might need to beef it up a little (at the cost of clarity, of course)."
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Is the pop filter alone enough or should this be combined with anything else such as a foam or cloth screen over the end of the microphone?,"If you wanna use it indoor, a pop filter is enough, this one is ideally large for the yeti. Foam has similar properties but is way more useful outside to reduce blowing noises like the wind."
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,How big is the clamping area?,"Hi Gerald. You will be able to clamp this pop filter onto a desk that's 1.25"" wide. Maybe slightly wider than that, but you would struggle to fit it to something 1.5"" wide. Hope that helps you make your decision about whether to get the flat clamp pop filter.  Regards, Lee"
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Is this a Book or the actual Pop Filter?,It's the filter.
Musical_Instruments,B00HBN6T1I,Is this a Book or the actual Pop Filter?,"It's the actual filter. You might find it a little awkward to use at first, but it does a good job."
