Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B005L9EEHU,Will this product work or damage Ugg Rohnan boots?  That style is not the typical Ugg sheepskin boots - but have waterproof full grain leather.,"It will definitely work.  Since the Rohnan boot is full grain smooth leather, sno seal will work perfectly. Just note that sno seal will definitely darken the boots' color, unless it is black to begin with.  One downside of sno seal is that after application, the surface of the leather becomes slightly tacky/sticky, which attracts dust and dirt.  Other than that, sno seal really does waterproof boots and shoes.  Just make sure you work sno seal into any seams and stitch work. And make sure to heat the boots and/or the sno seal to melt the wax into the leather."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B005L9EEHU,What if your boots already have salt stains?  Will this cover them up?,If your boots currently have salt stains embedded in leather. First you must thoroughly clean your boots with Saddle Soap boot cleaner. Make sure to also remove laces on boots to clean every area.  Let them dry overnight. Brush or wipe off all the Saddle Soap cleaner from boots. Then apply a thorough coating of Sno-Seal on boots. Use a hair dryer on warm setting to melt the Sno-Seal appl. on boots. Let boots sit overnight and brush or wipe off Sno-Seal next day. You may need to apply to applications of Sno-Seal on your boots to fully remove salt stains in leather. Good Luck.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Lock Laces - can you lace them up as tight as you want?,"Yes, and you bring up a good point about tight shoe laces.  Something as simple as keeping your laces tied up good might actually help prevent Achilles tendinitis! (if you do have it, suggest doing eccentric exercises like the kind in the book Treat Your Own Achilles Tendinitis). A 2010 study in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine showed that keeping your laces tied up did significantly reduce tension on your Achilles tendon - compared with untied laces."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Lock Laces - can you lace them up as tight as you want?,Yes.  They have good adjustability.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Lock Laces - can you lace them up as tight as you want?,Yes! You press down on the lock and get them as tight as you want by pulling the lace. Then release the lock. The lock can be a little hard to press down but it works great and stays in place.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,"Can these be used for water shoes, including water aerobics shoes which are in chlorinated pool water?","i havent used them in the water, so i dont know, but i would guess yes as lomg as you got white or a light color."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,"Can these be used for water shoes, including water aerobics shoes which are in chlorinated pool water?",Should be no different than the elastic in your bathing suit. Also you can replace the string if it breaks and still use the system.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Can you use more than one lace per shoe? That is so they'd work for work boots?,"But of course, it would require two locks also, but your answer is Yes!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Do you think these would work for someone with the use of only one arm? Currently using velcro closures.,"It takes two hands to set up the lock laces into place. Mainly slipping the laces into the lock wheel because it is not difficult but not easy to hold the button down, which opens the wheel, to allow the laces to thread into. After the set up process, fit the shoe how you want it to feel while wearing them and you will never need to tighten, loosen or use two hands to slip your shoes on again."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Do you think these would work for someone with the use of only one arm? Currently using velcro closures.,It will be pretty hard. It's possible but not simple. You need to squeeze the retainer and pull the laces tight at the same time.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Do you think these would work for someone with the use of only one arm? Currently using velcro closures.,"If someone else initially laced the shoes and adjusted the tightness, then getting your foot in and out with one hand would work well.  These would be very difficult to tighten with one hand. But most days there is no need to tighten them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Can you use the locks on regular laces?,No there would be no reason to do that. The laces are elastic and allow you to slip shoe on and off with ease and keep the laces from coming undone while exercising.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Can you use the locks on regular laces?,"The 'locks' have nothing to do with the function of the laces except to keep the ends from fraying. Lock laces are used IN PLACE of regular laces. Remove and discard the regular laces, replace with lock laces, cut off any excess and clip the 'locks' on the ends. The lock laces are ELASTIC to allow putting them on and off without tying."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,Can you use the locks on regular laces?,"you could, but without the stretchiness of the included lace material, not certain that would be an ideal solution. the locks have teeth designed for this material, but they would probably work on regular laces, too."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,what is the diameter of the cord?,"Not measured it, but it is thin.  It seems to hold up, haven't had them that long.  The narrow diameter lets you pull the shoot/boots open to rather easily get foot inside and then to pull that slack out i.e ""tie them"""
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,would these be appropriate/safe for basketball on court shoes...or are they too loose?,They are actually pretty tight. You can really make up snug.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,how do you unfasten the end cap?,Use a scissors and pry it out.  Be careful not to cut yourself.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDr7-7NAblY
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,how do you unfasten the end cap?,"You just pry open with either finger nail, key or similar object - it pops open."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,how do you unfasten the end cap?,At the end of the end cap there are the two recessed areas on each side.  One side has a tiny plastic latch that holds it shut.  Take a small screwdriver and push the latch down while prying open the end cap.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007DLVLFC,how do you unfasten the end cap?,"Use a small flat head screw driver and undo the clip. These laces are awesome. They're tight enough to allow your feet to be stable in the shoes, but do not cause pressure point issues."

The price seems very high for one tray and high for two trays.  When in doubt, go to the seller."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B007PKH1LY,"by ""stackable"" does that mean they fit inside of one another?",No. They stack on top. Whatever's inside would be safe as long as it isn't taller than the sides of the tray.
