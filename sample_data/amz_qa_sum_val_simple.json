I highly recommend you check your state and local laws before purchasing any firearm be it a .177cal or a .50cal.

It is an accurate BB gun. It should be treated as real and loaded when shooting. It is the same weight, dimensions and details as a Sig 9mm. The clip is heavy steel, the CO2 and BBs are loaded into it. I suggest practicing point shooting with it.Is this a real gun?, or a cool toy?

The handle isn't slippery when you shave but when you replace the blades the head pieces are slippery so you have to make sure you do it on a surface.is the handle slippery should it get wet or get some soap on it. and, does having a shorter handle make it more difficult to use?? The handle won't be slippery when wet, but it might when there's excessive soap on it. If you aren't sure, just give it a quick rinse since the water won't hurt it. Personally I like the shorter handle because there's better maneuverability and reminds that this isn't a cartridge razor so that you don't bear down like you might be used to doing. Hope this helps!is the handle slippery should it get wet or get some soap on it. and, does having a shorter handle make it more difficult to use?? Water doesn't make it slippery, but soap REALLY does.  The shorter handle doesn't make it difficult to use by any means.  But having a longer handle would make it easier.  If you aren't concerned about aesthetics, I've been tempted to wrap the handle tip with some tape or something for extra grip.  I love it regardless.  But then, I did buy to save money on blades, not because I like this type of razor.  It does offer great shaves, btw.is the handle slippery should it get wet or get some soap on it. and, does having a shorter handle make it more difficult to use?? The handle is not short.  Its a medium length DE razor handle.  Its longer than the Merkur 34C and shorter than the Merkur 23C.  In circumstances that cause this handle to be slippery I think you'll find that any other razor handle will also be slippery.  I don't find this razor handle more slippery than any other type of chrome plated razor handle.  What this razor has is probably the best \"curb appeal\" of any razor you'll probably ever see.  It will make you feel like the king you were always meant to be.is the handle slippery should it get wet or get some soap on it. and, does having a shorter handle make it more difficult to use?? The handle is a bit slippery if you get soap on it, but not when it is wet.  The lack of knurling is unfortunate, but with decently consistency lather, soap doesn't really proliferate the handle.  The handle length has not been an issue for me.is the handle slippery should it get wet or get some soap on it. and, does having a shorter handle make it more difficult to use?? It's chrome, of course it's going to get slippery!The knurling at the base of the handle however helps you keep it in place.The short handle is different if you've shaved with disposables. The concept is that with this razor, you don't press it into your face. You just lay it on your skin and let the weight of the razor do the work. The short handle helps keep you from torquing the blades into your face.Is this a three piece or twist to open? Hey Brian, this is a beautiful 3 piece razor.  You won't regret it if you buy one!Is this a three piece or twist to open? 3 pieceIs this a three piece or twist to open? You have to twist to open it. its a three piece the handle comes off after you unscrew it. then you take the top apart and insert the blade.

He takes the Edwin Jagger apart on the video. Thanks!Is this a three piece or twist to open? It's three pieces; handle, blade holder, and blade clamp.

Yes- my box said Sheffield EnglandWhat is the difference between this razor and the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome? The difference is in the handle in that the De89bl has a very smooth texture which looks nice but with a mix of soap and water makes it slippery and hard to handle.  The De89lbl has a lined handle has a lined handle with a texture with a little more grip and easier to handle.  Both razors use the same head design by Muhle.  The De89bl is more difficult to hold in slippery conditions but if your careful and patient is easy to master.  Hope this helps.What is the difference between this razor and the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome? As others pointed out the only difference is the handle.  I have not found the smooth handle to be a problem; in fact it is in my rotation this week.  If you are concerned this might be a problem then get one of the models that does not have the smooth handle.  The DE 89 series is a great razor.What is the difference between this razor and the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome? I believe that the Edwin Jagger De89lbl has a lined finish on the handle for gripping purposes. This is not the case with the De89bl as it has a smooth handle finish. I have not experienced any slippage with the grip on the smooth handle when shaving though.How does one adjust the amount of blade exposed?  Is it just a matter of the angle of the razor? This razor is non adjustable. There are others that are adjustable. The proper angle is what you'll need for this particular razor. Usually a 30 degree angle is what works.How does one adjust the amount of blade exposed?  Is it just a matter of the angle of the razor? I do not see how one would ajust this razors blade exposure.

Because if that happens those body parts will be stuck in the propellers until the motor turn off.

{"asin": "B003D95U0A", "text": "does this humidifier leave white dust ?Thanks Jeff No white dust with this unit. This is an evaporative humidifier where the filter  soaks up the water and the fan draws air through the wet filter.  The air retains some of the moisture as it passes through the filter. The minerals are left behind in the filter.  The white dust is produced by ultrasonic humidifiers that use a device similar to a speaker to vaporized the water. the minerals in the water vaporize also and later settle out on everything as a coating of white dust.does this humidifier leave white dust ?Thanks Jeff If you sanitize it on a regular basis, once to twice a week, there should be no dust. The humidifier sucks air in through the bottom and filters it through a filter which is damp and due to the filter the air that comes out is cleaner than the air going in. Hope this helps. Its a good product and amazon has replacement filters for it 3 for $30 i think. I like this humidifier and recommend it.does this humidifier leave white dust ?Thanks Jeff What may appear as white dust may be from the water source that has dried.  The water in the area that I had to use in the unit also left a similar residue, but it is not harmful.  It has to do with the area having hard water and me not choosing to use distilled water for the unit.  If you are extremely concerned and financially capable, you may choose to try distilled water, change your filter, run bleach through the system and see if the effect is still noticed.does this humidifier leave white dust ?Thanks Jeff Jeff, I would have to say no, because I never saw any.  After reading all the other answers - I still say no, and I use water right out of the tap.

There are additives that you can buy that will keep the filter from becoming saturated with deposits, but I think most filters are good for two to three months of intermittent usage.  Just check the filter to see if it is building up too much hard water deposits and not retaining its original flexibility and moisture wicking ability.how often does the filter need to be changed?

What is the specific purpose of the Flash Bracket? Too get the light above eye level and avoid red eye, most pro photographers use a detachable light and hold the light at arms length above when flash photos are taken.  Then the lighting result looks more natural as light is coming from a slight angle...so bracket raises light some but higher is usually better.General Question. What is the specific purpose of the Flash Bracket? Greetings, I would say that typically this bracket is used for holding and using a flash when the hot-shoe on your camera is being occupied by something else.  I use an Olympus E-PL1 with a VF-2 viewfinder, so my hot-shoe is being taken up by the viewfinder.  Using this bracket, I can use my VF2 and an External Flash, I've also found that the grip on the side (which is a sturdy foam) give a bit more control and less shake to my camera.  Their are multiple screw mount points on the bottom of the Bracket, I would imagine that it would fit most cameras.General Question. What is the specific purpose of the Flash Bracket? It moves the light source higher at a more flattering angle to your subject.  This angle throws any shadow below the subject and in most cases out of site.  It also helps prevent red eye and blinking.  Another advantage is that it maintains a better point of light while slowing the camera to rotate from horizontal to vertical.  Hope this helps.General Question. What is the specific purpose of the Flash Bracket? You can get a much better lighting angle of your flash than you would probably get from the top of your camera. You could also  turn the flash to sideways with the rotating bracket. Comes handy if you do not have walls or reflectors to bounce light. If you add a soft box for your flash, you would a much nicer tone especially if you are shooting people -- the pictures come out definitely better. The grip too lends a hand in handling your kit.General Question. What is the specific purpose of the Flash Bracket? It gets the flash above the camera for different/better flash positioning and provides a handle for better camera control.  The bracket allows for reposition of the flash away from the top of the camera for different flash effects.Are all the structural parts of this bracket made of metal (aluminum) and NOT plastic?

However there are enough louvers to let a nice breeze in the house.Do the louvers expand as well? I don't know what you mean about the louvers expanding.

I put the screen on the outside, though I would think you could do it either way according to preference.  If you don't have a storm window screen on the outside of your window, then I would put the screen on the outside (bugs, you know).

Not sure if anyone is still looking for an answer but you can go to manufacturer's site (Nisaku tools) and look it up. According to them it's 420J2 stainless steel.What is the grade of the stainless steel? Don't know the grade but it is a very high quality product.  My son (a professional landscaper) uses one all the time in his work.  I use it in the garden and have nothing bad to say.What is the grade of the stainless steel? It is absolutely excellent.  I had another hori-hori that a friend broke a few years ago that I had used for at least 10-12 years.  This one is at least as good as that one was.  I expect to have it for the rest of my life!  It is the only garden tool you need.What is the grade of the stainless steel? As others have mentioned, the exact grade of the steel isn't listed anywhere.  Given the reasonable price point for this, I doubt it would be anything fancier  than a 440 variant or similar.  But it must be tempered very well because it definitely holds its edge.What is the grade of the stainless steel? I carefully looked through the pouch and the knife, but can't see anywhere about the grade.  I can only tell from my experiences that it is very solid and sharp.

Cross guard would be helpful but would make usage a little more cumbersome. Best not to force into soil, but to work in at angle gradually.Given the lack of a crossguard, has anyone experienced cuts from their grip slipping while gardenning? This is my most often used garden tool.  I've never had my hand slip ever while using this tool.  I recommend using gloves if you do much work with it as it will leave the palm of your hand sore if you do a lot of weeding with it.  I also recommend that you sharpen it at least once each season depending on use.  A sharp tool works better and requires less effort. I had the same concerns you do before I started using it.  I have another version of this tool with a guard but like this one better.  I forgot about the guard thing until you asked about it.Given the lack of a crossguard, has anyone experienced cuts from their grip slipping while gardenning? No, I just get a blister in the palm of my hand because of the way I work with it.  I can understand your thought though.  Using a thumb against a crossguard with a complete palm around the grip would certainly aleviate the blister but then how could an indistructable crossguard be made around the strong and unbreakable blade.  I guess the Japanese are more agile with the tool.  Dorothy in NYGiven the lack of a crossguard, has anyone experienced cuts from their grip slipping while gardenning? I have frond no problem at all.  You do have to use care when using the knife because it is very, very sharp.  But that is what makes this a GREAT tool.  I have found that since I always have the scabbard on my belt in the same spot when hardening, I can even slide the knife in without looking, just by feel.

At the same time, I think I still prefer a regular tough trowel.How thick is the blade on this tool? The blade is 1 1/2\" wide at the widest part of the cutting area, somewhat concave and, in my estimation, is sturdy enough to outlast me, my son, and his kids.  I don't know how to figure thickness without a measuring tool but tend to expect my tools to stand up to hard use.

I don't recommend continuous use and it's not meant for large backyards or large front lawns (it will just take forever, better off with a real mower), but overall I'd say its like a trimmer on steroids.

It does a great job getting where it is difficult or impossible to get a mower.  That said, it always cuts too low for me, even with the wheels on the higher setting.

Yet it's a wonderful idea and I love it.Compared to the job a blade does cutting the grass, how well would you say this trimmer compares? Blade mower is much better when cutting thick grass and when the lawn is essentially flat.  This mower struggles in areas where grass is thick.But this mower cut as well as any electric trimmer/edger without tiring your arms and shoulder.

Technically, it's an FX lens. In other words, it will cover the full frame format sensor. However, I use this lens on a DX format camera. Since the DX sensor is smaller the end result is that this lens becomes a 120mm to 600mm! The smaller sensor nets you an additional 1.5X magnification. It will work on either format. I mount this zoom on my D7100 (DX) body which has an additional 1.3x crop factor built in! That way, the 600mm, effectively becomes 780mm! The images are crisp as one can expect from Nikon.Is this a FX or DX lens? The spec's I've seen on this lens indicate this as compatible with FX and DX cameras. This lens is my work-horse for shooting birds in flight with a D7000 (a DX camera body).Is this a FX or DX lens? This is a full frame (FX) lens.

This means that you will be shooting the equivalen of 600mm at the long end!does this lens work with the nikon d5200 The 80-400 does not have an integral autofocus motor (AF-S), so the D5200 will not autofocus with this lens.

Neither your camera or this lens have built in focus motors.does this lens work with the nikon d5200 I'm not sure, but if you go to the Nikon USA web site and look under customer service you can find a 1-800 number to call. They will tell you.Will this lens work on a D3200? It will work but since it is an FX lens your new focal length will be 120mm - 600mmWill this lens work on a D3200? On the D3100, this lens will not autofocus because it does not have its own internal focusing mechanism.  I believe the D3200 is a newer version of the D3100 and also requires a lens with its own SWM (\"silent wave motor\") for autofocus.  Thus, you can use this on your D3200 only in manual focus.I have a Nikon D3000 will this lens work on this model LeeAnn, yes! it will work with any Nikon DSLR, \"F\" mount camera.

Maybe.  I have tried it on a D3100 and the auto focus doesn't work.  I have used it also on D70, D200 and D600 - it works on all three of those but the AF is slow.  You can manually focus on the D3100 and it works fine.  It's doubtful that Nikon changed the D3200 so that the AF would function.

I believe it is made in ChinaCan this be used on a BBQ set? yes thican used on agas grill it's heavy duty stainless steel or in an oven easy to clean put your beer or juice with whatever spice you're using buy it and enjoyHow easy is clean up and can you use the dishwasher or just hand wash? very easy to clean - take apart and put in your dishwasher.How easy is clean up and can you use the dishwasher or just hand wash? It gets dirty with chicken fat and juices but cleans up perfectly in the dishwasher. Mine still looks like new. No pre-soaking needed at all.How easy is clean up and can you use the dishwasher or just hand wash? I have used dishwasher and by hand, cleans up well.  Put a dish under this though because depending on how juicy the chicken is, it will over flow or be right at the rim.How large of a bird can you use with this roaster? You can put on a  large roaster.  A turkey would be too large.  The bird sits on top and the flavors are infused right into the chicken.   This is used instead of an actual beer can so it is healthier.  The chicken comes out so moist.How large of a bird can you use with this roaster? It's very sturdy so can take all sizes of bird. I've used it on an extra large chicken with no problems. As others here have said, the overall issue with this is the height of the chicken in the oven !How large of a bird can you use with this roaster? Sitting on the lowest rack one needs 12 inch clearance.  My Bosch oven will accommodate a 5 to 6 lb chicken.How large of a bird can you use with this roaster? I can only guess from having used it twice.  I think it wouldhandle at least a 7 lb bird; it's sturdy and well made, but Ionly used a 3-5 lb bird.How large of a bird can you use with this roaster? This depends on where your going to used the roaster.  If on a grill, a large (7 to 8 lbs.) chicken would probable fit.  I live in a studio and have a small oven.  Therefore, I usually use a small bird (3 to 4 lbs) sitting on a baking sheet on the lowest level of my oven and still have problems fitting the bird.How large of a bird can you use with this roaster? Sorry but I am not sure.  I usually cook a whole chicken on it...about 3 to 5 lbs.  You probably could put a small turkey or capon on it but I think the legs would be far over the sides so you would have to put it on a flat pan in the oven to catch the dripping juices.  Hope that makes sense.smlCan it be used for other roasts? As long as the roast is a bird weighing less than 4 lbs, no problem.Can it be used for other roasts? I don't really see how that could be done.  It's shaped like a cone so you could sit the bird's cavity over it, so there wouldn't really be any way to prop a roast of beef or pork over it.  I think it's only use is for chickens and turkeys.Can it be used for other roasts? I doubt is, as you need to have a cavity to insert the vertical piece into.Can it be used for other roasts? It's only for roasting poultry, and should probably only be used for a 3-4lb bird. That being said, it works great!Can it be used for other roasts? I wouldn't think so unless you hollow the roast out in the middle.Can it be used for other roasts? I don't think so. The part that goes inside the chicken is blunt and rounded. You would not be able to insert it into a solid roast. I hope this helps.Can it be used for other roasts? I suppose it COULD be used for other roasts if you made a cavity for it to sit on the roaster. That is a good question, and I will have to try it. Small turkeys and even Cornish Game hens cook beautifully tender.Can it be used for other roasts? The product description says this breaks down into a horizontal roaster and one of the product images actually shows that, so yes, you could use it for roasts.Can it be used for stovetop? Not a good idea. Should be only used in stove or barbecue. There is a risk of grease splattering and making a big mess.Can it be used for stovetop? It is stainless still.  I haven't tried, but I don't see why you can't as the material is pretty heavy duty and you can put it on the grill.  Only caution is, the drip pan is not wide enough so the drips will be on your stove.  I use a baking sheet underneath it to capture the drips so I don't have to clean the oven.   Good luckCan it be used for stovetop? No, It is for roasting a whole chicken.  I don't know how you would do that on a stoveCan it be used for stovetop? yes it be used on the stovetop also a bbq  wrap the chicken up with alum. foil with a pan underneath it check temp of chick with food thermometer for doneness good luckCan it be used for stovetop? no, it cannot be, Use it only in your oven end expect a wonderful dish.How big (DxH)  is the rack? A large chicken can fit on top of this.  It will fit n a stove.  The chicken comes out really moist and delicious.How big (DxH)  is the rack? It's actually smaller than it seems from the picture on line.  It's only about 6 or 7 inches, but it's VERY stable for large or small chickens.  Depending on your oven, you might have to put on bottom oven rack, but it should fit just fine!  Cleans up easy and stores easy too!

This is made for more of a regular chicken or Cornish game hen.Can this be used in a Char-Broil The Big Easy to cook a 12-15 lb turkey? No - I don't believe that Norpro would work on a turkey that big. I have used it for 6 lbs chickens and that is about as big as I would go.Can this be used in a Char-Broil The Big Easy to cook a 12-15 lb turkey? No, it's not big enough for a Turkey.

You need to check the product description t confirm this.Is this able to hold A4 size paper target? not familiar with a4 - size it takes = 5 x 5 1/2Would this hold up better if filled with shreaded paper or some other material??Ideas?? pellets and bb's dont hurt it, a couple of paint schips. otherwise no damage. dont know how it would hold up to 22cal's thoughWould this hold up better if filled with shreaded paper or some other material??Ideas?? I packed mine with modeling clay. Quieter too.Would this hold up better if filled with shreaded paper or some other material??Ideas?? I don't think so! The deflector plate is the weak part. But in fairness, I was shooting a Gamo air rifle that propels the pettets at a higher speed (1400 fps) than trap is rated for. Stuffings it might keep the pellets from being deflected into the area designed to receive the spent pellet. I hope this is helpful.Would this hold up better if filled with shreaded paper or some other material??Ideas?? I don't think so. Even if you find something like cork  I would guess that you will need to replace it. I punched a hole through the back after 500 pellets or so. I ended up welding two 2 mm thick steel door frame anchors to the back of the trap. Now it is holding fine but the trap looks like something out of MadMax. I'll post some pictures in a couple of days.Would this hold up better if filled with shreaded paper or some other material??Ideas?? I shoot in my bedroom sometimes(BIG bedroom)and the pellets come onto the floor sometimes. So some type of material might stop this. I have not had it long enough to say any more. The T shirt trick might stop that. Have not tried it yet.Would this hold up better if filled with shreaded paper or some other material??Ideas?? The issue is not damage in transit.  The metal from which the trap is made is too thin.  It simply cannot the absorb the impact of a pellet without significant damage.  The pellet that I used were for target shooting not the ones used for hunting.  I can send a picture showing the damage that one pellet caused.would this be a good non-messy airsoft target (so i dont have to pick up all the bb's) Yes, should be excellentwould this be a good non-messy airsoft target (so i dont have to pick up all the bb's) Yes, this would be an excellent way to avoid picking up the bb\"s!would this be a good non-messy airsoft target (so i dont have to pick up all the bb's) Yes, altho a few will hit the bakstop at just the right angle to ricochette back thru the target.  Wear eye peotection.would this be a good non-messy airsoft target (so i dont have to pick up all the bb's) yes but I recommend placing some stirophom in the traget holder so nothing comes out", "summary": "The pellet trap does not allow you to reuse pellets. Used pellets will not be reusable even if not deformed by the trap. The pellet trap should work with an airsoft gun as long as the BBs can penetrate the paper targets. The pellet trap works by having the pellet go through the target and being directed into a small receptacle by an angled back plate. The receptacle can be emptied. The pellet trap needs to be mounted on a post with two screws fitted into keyholes for easy set up and take down. The pellet trap includes 100 Gamo paper targets. The pellet trap accommodates targets of 5 x 5 1/2. It is unknown if this is sufficient for an A4 target. The pellet trap does not require additional cushioning material for pellets and bbs other than to prevent minor paint chipping. The pellet trap's ability to withstand 22 cal rounds is unknown. The pellet trap will work well as a target to collect bbs from an airsoft. "}

This tool is sooooo cool.  Yes, it will suck up stink bugs.  It grabs little tiny spiders and big spiders and anything creepy and crawly.  It actually makes sucking up the bugs fun!  My oldest daughter asked us to get 2 more so we could have one on every floor.Will it work with stink bugs? It works great with stink bugs. That is why we got it. We keep one upstairs, downstairs & at work. Works great with spiders too. My son said it \"makes catching bugs a sport\".Will it work with stink bugs? Never tried it but unless they are holding on very tenaciously it should work.  Don't know whether the stink will be a problem.Will it work with stink bugs? It's perfect for stink bugs.  Our Bugzooka came with a spare bug-catching compartment, and it does help to wash one out when you empty it.  We found after using it all last fall and winter that we have a lot fewer stink bugs this year, too.  And there's something really satisfying about stalking and catching them.  Ours are too dumb to fly away even when we put the thing right next to them to suck them up.What is the difference between the BugZooka Bug Catcher Vacuum that costs $25.00 and the one that costs $35.00? Probably nothing. But they are only good for small bugs.What is the difference between the BugZooka Bug Catcher Vacuum that costs $25.00 and the one that costs $35.00? Seems to be the same machine. They're using the same photo. Just sold by a different seller on amazon. I still love ours. Hope they make one for really big bugs one day. We've had ours for over 5 years at least now.What is the difference between the BugZooka Bug Catcher Vacuum that costs $25.00 and the one that costs $35.00? We have one of each. They are identical. As stated by the previous comment:\"Just sold by a different seller on amazon.\" To sum it up: The BugZooka is one of the best and most effective tools we ever got!!!What is the difference between the BugZooka Bug Catcher Vacuum that costs $25.00 and the one that costs $35.00? 1st thing is to review both Vacums vs each other. my cost was at the low end, as for the intended use is applicable.It says \"push the trigger.\"  Do you have to hold it or is it an on/off switch? On/off. Just push and release and your bug gets sucked into the machineIt says \"push the trigger.\"  Do you have to hold it or is it an on/off switch? It is a button.  Once the device is \"cocked\" it remains that way until you push the button and activate the bug grabbing suction.It says \"push the trigger.\"  Do you have to hold it or is it an on/off switch? There is no on or off switch. You simply push in the plunger and hit the red button.If no battery, how does it get its power? It uses suction. There's a compartment at the bottom you push in to create pressure, then the compartment is released when you press the button, drawing in air quickly.If no battery, how does it get its power? Its a plunger suction. We love it for getting bugs.If no battery, how does it get its power? At the base, note large black according type bellows, a suction is produced whenever;  1) the  spring loaded bellow is depressed & 2) trigger button (under thumb in photo) pressed. This will produce sufficient air intake to capture a large wasp or hornet. It is perfect for collecting stink bugs.If no battery, how does it get its power? You push the plunger in at the bottom. Then there is a button you push when you are ready to catch the bug. Then the suction just sucks it right into the compartment in the tube. I'm happy I purchased it! Works great!If no battery, how does it get its power? It is powered by suction. You push in the end and then push a button when centered over bug and it sucks it in. Very effective. You can empty in toilet or outside trashcan when full. Bugs generally die after being in there for a few days.Once the insect has been sucked up into the BugZooka, what prevents it from crawling out? There is a trap door that is opened with suction but closes and traps the bug in the chamber at the end of the wand. To release the bug, remove the chamber and tip the bug out.Once the insect has been sucked up into the BugZooka, what prevents it from crawling out? There is a 2 wings barrier only open toward inside so no way to escape. To empty by pulling the top partof the trapper out.Once the insect has been sucked up into the BugZooka, what prevents it from crawling out? The end of the BugZooka is covered by a piece of hinged plastic.  It opens when the button is depressed (sucking in the bug) and immediately closes.This is a great device, glad I purchased it!Once the insect has been sucked up into the BugZooka, what prevents it from crawling out? Number one, most of those little critters aren't that smart or coordinated. But it has little screens that open and close.Once the insect has been sucked up into the BugZooka, what prevents it from crawling out? It can't get out, because the trap doors close in on it. You have to take the tip off and let the bug out. I gave mine to good-will. It's and under-powered toy as far as I'm concerned.Can it pick up multiple bugs at a time? Not unless they are ontop of each other. It uses a short burst of vacuumed air from compressing the chamber. One bug at a time and ideally ones which are not moving as the top is small and narrow. You won't be emptying out a bee hive with it.Can it pick up multiple bugs at a time? I just put this in the salvation army donation box. It's an underpowered piece of junk and I don't want it in my house any longer.  I am going to find something with a motor. In my opinion, it is a gimmick. Don't waste your money. MLBCan it pick up multiple bugs at a time? If the bugs are small enough. The catching container trap is about 1\" dia. by 2\" long.Can it pick up multiple bugs at a time? yesf bade each other more tan one bug will be drawn into tube. The suction is great enough to lift both bugs.Can it pick up multiple bugs at a time? If they are small.  A bunch of flies or small spiders, yes.  Works AMAZING, just has a receptacle area that's fairly small.  I just ripped a regular sized Post it Note into 6 pieces and scrunched them up.  The first try, the BugZooka captured 3 of the 6 pieces.  I \"reloaded\" and captured 2 more.  The last (biggest) piece took 3 more tries.  Most bugs would run off by then!Can it pick up multiple bugs at a time? If you're talking about catching one after another, but leaving them in the container, yes. You can suck up one bug, re-compress the chamber, and then suck up more bugs. The first one will not be able to get out. I have done this twice. Then you can empty them all at once.Does it pick up roaches? No. Roaches are too big for it.Does it pick up roaches? Never had the occasion but it shouldDoes it pick up roaches? good question!  I use the bugzooka exclusively for stink bugs so I'm not sure.Does it pick up roaches? Size-wise it will pick up roaches (maybe not Florida or Texas sized ones), but you have to be quick enough to trap them under the nozzle. Great for stink bugs, which are very slow.Does it pick up roaches? Yes, actually it does. The suction is quite strong, more than enough for large roaches. It is unfortunate that they get injured this way because they are so large, but since they are headed for extermination at my house anyway, I am just grateful to have the long tube between me and the bug.Will it pick up 5 to 6 inch centipedes? Anything larger than a stinkbug will not fit. It will tear up any bug that is delicate, like a moth. It is more made for beetles, small bees, small spiders, stinkbugs, etc. Any bug longer or larger than the diameter of the circle that sucks the bugs in will be damaged by the forceful suction. That defeats the purpose of the product to get bugs outside alive.Will it pick up 5 to 6 inch centipedes? The BugZooka is absolutely unbeatable when it comes to catching stinkbugs, ladybugs, flies, spiders, crickets, etc. It works so well that we have have two BugZookas, one on the top floor and one  the main floor of our house.

Approx. how many coats will it hold? the rack is adjustable in height and holds 15 of my coats,jackets,fur,etc., very strudy and the lentgh is 4.5 feetWhat is length of the coat rack? Approx. how many coats will it hold? The length is 5 feet.  How many coats it will hold will depend on the size and thickness of your coats, so I can't help with that.What is length of the coat rack? Approx. how many coats will it hold? Hi Angela. The only approximation someone can give is the length. It's exactly 5ft. Beyond that I doubt anyone can accurately answer the second part of your question \"how many coats it will hold\". The reason being no two homes will have exactly the same coats or materials. If someone has all down filled vests, jackets and/or heavy wool winter coats etc. The rack will get filled up fast compared to coats with other materials or thing Pea Coats. I hope this helps.What is length of the coat rack? Approx. how many coats will it hold? 60\" (5 feet). As long as they don't weigh more than 250lbs, the answer is -- as many as you can hang on a 5' hanger.Can this be stored easily under a bed when not in use?  Is it collapsible? Per Classic Store Fixtures... No this rack is not collapsible, its is bolted togeather by 6 bolts to assemble or disassemble.. you would be interested in the \"Salesman\" Rack. Here is the listing ID for that one ASIN: B00070ENH4. That rack as no screws/ bolts and is collapsible down to 3 inches high for easy storage like under the bed. Also Be carefull who you buy this rack from, there are many non commercial verisons of this rack and many sellers say they carry the commercial version but they really do not. thanksBen Elkins Classic Store FixturesCan this be stored easily under a bed when not in use?  Is it collapsible? No, I don't think that it could fit under a bed and it is not collapsible.  There is a way to raise the height (although I am not sure why you would want to because it is already so tall).  We keep ours in our garage and I pull it inside on laundry days.  It is very sturdy and thus very heavy.  It is almost too heavy for me to easily lift up the garage stairs into the house but I manage each week and know that I will never need to buy another one because this is so well built.Can this be stored easily under a bed when not in use?  Is it collapsible? not collapsible so quick storage is a problem.  If you want to take the time to undo all the screws it can be taken APART for storage.  This is the best rack I have ever gotten because it is so sturdy.Can this be stored easily under a bed when not in use?  Is it collapsible? Yes, it can easily be stored under a bed. All the bars can be unscrewed separately. It's really convenient. Worth every penny!Apparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? Per Classic Store Fixtures... No it is not possible unless you know someone who can cut and weld the top bar and replace the tear drop ends, then would be possible. There are clothing racks other that are 4 ft long you might be interested in. Also be careful who you buy this rack from there are many on amazon advertising the commercial version but do not really sell the true commecial grade version of this Garment Rack thanks Ben Elkins Classic Store FixturesApparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? The bar cannot be shortened as there is no way to adjust it.  Only the sides can be raised or lowered.Apparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? The rack that I purchased is very well built and will hold lots of seasonal clothes.  It rolls very well and is very sturdy, no tipping, as I roll it in and out of a closet.  It is well worth the money. The hanging bar is not adjustable (can not shorten).Apparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? No, but perhaps Yes.As others have pointed out, 'adjustable' pertains to the height, not the width.  The top bar is not adjustable, and is fixed at 60\".  If this rack _really_ meets your needs otherwise, it's possible to saw off each end of the top bar outside the attachment to the uprights without affecting the integrity of the stand as a whole.  But that's a lot of work if you can find another rack elsewhere that meets your needs.Apparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? No.  It is a solid bar.  You can adjust the height by raising or lowering it, but the width is fixed.Apparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? I think you could because like it says that it's adjustable. Each end has holes where you can bring it up or down and then the bottom part you can pull it in and out. It's very sturdy and it holds ALOT of clothing. Good luck.Apparently, the total length of the top bar is 60\", with about 6\" overhang on each end. Would it be possible to shorten that length to about 50\"? NOT possible. But if you can find the space for this thing, you'd like it.Does this rack extend on either side Per Classic Store Fixtures..  No this rack does not have the 12\" pull out extentions like the Salesman rack.  The Hang-rail is 58\" long. This rack is a very strong commercial grade rack with height adjustable from 46\" to 66\". Also Be carefull who you buy this rack from, there are many non commercial verisons of this rack and many sellers say they carry the commercial version but they really do not. thanksBen Elkins Classic Store FixturesDoes this rack extend on either side It is fixed length and width, adjustable height. The ends extend about 6 inches from the vertical posts.Does this rack extend on either side If you're asking if the width can be adjusted, no.

Chris is correct - the teleconverter will work with your D3200, but not with the 55-300 lens.

I don't think you will even be able to mount that lens. Nikon has a compatibility chart on their website. This teleconverter will only mount on certain lenses.will this work with the AF-S Nikkor 55-300 VR Lens on a D3200 Nikon camera in auto focus? Hi, no I do not believe it will.  I found out the hard way that Nikon for some reason does not note that the converter works with only select high end Nikon lenses.  Now the Tamron converter will work with all lenses and I have found it works great.  Testing both lenses, autofocus is slower on the converters equally and you loose two F stops.  Nikon's website has the manual for the converter or you can google it as a PDF file to see the lenses it works with.will this work with the AF-S Nikkor 55-300 VR Lens on a D3200 Nikon camera in auto focus? I ended up returning the item. I believe it is only for a fixed lens not a zoom. I hope this helps.will this work with the AF-S Nikkor 55-300 VR Lens on a D3200 Nikon camera in auto focus? I believe this will not work with any kind of 55 mm lens because the rear element complex would extend back into the TC.

These include the D4/D4S, Df, D800/D800E, D810, D600/ D610, D750 and D7100.\"Will this work on Nikon D7100 and Nikon 80-400 mm f/4.5 - 5.6 G ED VR AF-Sl Nikkor lens.  Nikon Comp. Chart says yes but has anyone used it? I believe it is compatible with the exception of Autofocus whichever I think eases to work at f5.6 therefore because of losing 2 stops with the converter only lenses of f2.8 and larger (f1.8. f1.4 etc ) will have autofocus the lens you are asking about is compatible ( but you will have to focus manually). Check Nikons web site for compatabiltyWhat is the difference between the TC-20EII and the TC-20EIII? The optical formula in the TC-20EIII was changed, and most commenters conclude that the III is a significant improvement.  The more practical difference is that the III will be autofocus compatible with more Nikkor lenses.Will this work with the Nikon d800e and an attached AF-S Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II lens? Yes, which can be used and it is a good combination.Will this work with the Nikon d800e and an attached AF-S Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II lens? Yes. I use it on a D800 with 70-200 f/2.8G ED VRII, and it works like a charm. Image quality is a bit lower than without, but the AF works quite well.Will this work with the Nikon d800e and an attached AF-S Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II lens? It works, but I don't think it's worth it.  I returned the converter.  Cropping will result in better quality.Will this work with the Nikon d800e and an attached AF-S Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II lens? I would think yes, I use it on my d700 with a Nikon 70-200 VR11 lens with excellent results. I don't think Nikon changed anything about the mount on the d800. If they had there would be a new Teleconvertor for the d800.Will this teleconverter work with a 105mm macro lens to double the size of the image? Nikon says no --but it will. Just don't expect prime lens performance. Most people in most cases will not see the difference.Will this teleconverter work with a 105mm macro lens to double the size of the image? Want work with my camera so I have no idea about the lens .I have a D5000 and a 55-200 DX Series lens. Will this work and give full functions? It will not work with that lens.Is it compatible with nikon D5200 with nikon 18-300 mm lens? Sorry, but it is not compatible with the lens.  You generally need a 2.8 or larger (smaller number) aperature lens.  You should go on the Nikon websiteand check the teleconverter compatibility chart before buying a teleconverter or lens to use with a teleconverter.Is it compatible with nikon D5200 with nikon 18-300 mm lens? My guess would be that the TC-20E III would be compatible w/ your D5200 camera, but DEFINITELY not w/ the 18-300 mm lens.  You can check out which lenses it is compatible with by following this link to Nikons website.  http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-Teleconverter-TC-20E-III.htmlIs it compatible with nikon D5200 with nikon 18-300 mm lens? Just a follow up on my previous response to your question.  I use the TC-20E III with the D7000 and the AF-S Nikkor 300mm f/4D IF-ED lens and get excellent results on bright sunny days.  If its dark and cloudy it will search for focus, but then I just switch to manual.

The case includes one front 120mm fan and an optional second 80 mm fan. The rear fan is missing, but has a 92mm slot. If the dimension length on a MSI Computer Corp. Video Graphics Card R9 270 is smaller than 14.1 inches it should fit in the micro atx Case according to the product page on Amazon. The IT Guy San Diego explains that this product includes the mobo standoffs and screws necessary , and all the average tidbits to build a PC. The majority of this product is made from Aluminium, and the front is hard plastic. There is incompatibility with the Gigabyte Motherboard GA-Z97-D3H and this case. This case has just 4 expansion slot covers, as it is the micro version of the ATX case. Your motherboard has 7 slots, and is therefore too big. The full sized version or a mid tower will work for you. This case has an front fan on intake, as is standard, and should have the exhaust in the back or top. It is possible to flip the fan, but would be a mistake. The stock fan is a functional Silverstone 120mm with speeds of about 1100-1200RPM. It is nearly silent. You can have more intake by purchasing an 80mm fan with speeds of 1400-1700RPM, to be installed under the 120mm fan in the cutout, with 4 screws that come with the new fan. A water cooling system can be installed in this unit, but will be a tight fit. "}

Hi Thomas , sorry for delayer response just wanted to double check with my supplier \\, the Sheridan 2260MB CO2 Rifle air rifle manufactured in the USA.ThanksPhilAre all .22 pellet rifles one shot? Why? Since they are air powered, all the air is expelled on each shot (for pump-up style rifles). For break barrel style pellet guns, it's not possible to load more than one because the action of breaking the barrel down is what compresses spring to make the shot, and there's no way to get another pellet into the barrel until you break it down. If you want a repeating rifle, you'll probably have to go for a CO2 powered gun.Are all .22 pellet rifles one shot? Why? Both .177 abd the .22 cal PELLET  pistol and rifles are single shot. If they also shoot BB's, which are .177, then you can load multiple BB's , but not multiple pellets. They would jamb unless you had a clip and a feed chamber like regular rifles and ACP pistols.Are all .22 pellet rifles one shot? Why? Are you guys blind? The product and most reviews clearly state this is a SPRING operated rifle. There is no air involved in propelling the projectile out. That said, the reason it is single shot only is the spring fully discharges with each shot. It puts a hell of a lot of force behind the shot too. So be aware that this is not intended as a toy for children. This is a rifle, not a toy.

This is great wine fridge at a reasonable price.How far do the shelves pull out? Can you see/get to the middle bottle on each shelf easily? Not far enough. Definitely a con of this model. In addition, we just installed ours last week & are already having issues.How far do the shelves pull out? Can you see/get to the middle bottle on each shelf easily? The shelves pull out just a few inches.  The middle bottle on each shelf has to be placed the opposite way of the other two bottles to fit.  You can only see when you pull the shelf out.  The shelf slides easily and I dont consider it a detriment. We have had ours for almost a year.  It works great.How far do the shelves pull out? Can you see/get to the middle bottle on each shelf easily? The shelves come out about 4 inches.  Don't know why so little but it's enough to read the bottle.   Because the middle bottle has to be reversed from the two bottles beside it, you have to take a side bottle out to get to the middle bottle.   Not a problem for us, and we like the looks, readouts and cooling.How far do the shelves pull out? Can you see/get to the middle bottle on each shelf easily? The shelves pull out 4.5 inches.  Thee bottles will fit on each shelf, but since one of the bottles must be in a reverse position, you can't really see it well and it's not very accessible as it must be pushed to the rear of the shelf in order for 3 bottles to fit on the shelf.  In terms of seeing the bottles, the idea of the light is real nice when the cooler is empty but worthless for all but the top shelf when bottles are stored.  I am considering tagging the bottles or keeping a list of which wine is stored on each shelf as viewing the bottle labels is all but impossibleHow far do the shelves pull out? Can you see/get to the middle bottle on each shelf easily? Yes. The shelves will actually pull all the way out as they are not attached but just sit on grooves in the sidewall. I have some with 3 bottles to a shelf and others with 2. With the wide range of bottle shapes and sizes its hard to fill all shelves unless you prefer only one or two brandsHow far do the shelves pull out? Can you see/get to the middle bottle on each shelf easily? The shelves pull out about 7 inches.  You can get three bottles on every shelf except for the bottom one.  If you put three bottles on each shelf, you would have to take the middle bottle out to see the names of the other two bottles, but if you only put two bottles on each shelf, you can see the names easily.

Champagne reduces the total cooler capacity but they do fit within the shelf heights.will larger sized bottles such as champagne bottles fit in the drawers and will that reduce number of bottles? The top drawers have more room for larger sized bottles, but the normal space configuration gives plenty of room for most larger sized wine bottles.  You can always remove a drawer for really large bottles, but this will obviously reduce your bottle capacity.  36 bottles are a lot and I do not fill the cooler to capacity anyway.  I am very pleased with my unit and highly recommend it.will larger sized bottles such as champagne bottles fit in the drawers and will that reduce number of bottles? The inside is situated with molded walls (like an oven) into which the shelves slide.  I can fit my larger bottles into the fridge but then only about 2 per shelf (instead of 3) across and I have to move the shelf above up one which then makes the next row too small for a regular bottle so I lose a row as well.  On these \"skinny\" rows I place my very slender liquour bottles which works well - - but yes, you lose space both horizontally as well as vertically.will larger sized bottles such as champagne bottles fit in the drawers and will that reduce number of bottles? Wider based bottles are a very tight fit, if they fit at all, and though I haven't tried I doubt you'd get three bottles to a shelf. The shelves, overall, are extremely tight and offer very little extra room for anything other than the standard 750ml bottle size and shape.will larger sized bottles such as champagne bottles fit in the drawers and will that reduce number of bottles? Sharon,We've had the EdgeStar now for almost a year and our daughter liked ours so much that when she had her kitchen remodeled she had one installed.  Yes, we both keep champagne in it.  You'll have to stagger them a bit that is if you have the top of a bottle facing out, you'll have to face out the bottom of the bottle underneath, but the number of bottles is not reduced.  I hope this info helps.Stuwill larger sized bottles such as champagne bottles fit in the drawers and will that reduce number of bottles? Sharon,  Larger bottles fit fine.

Probably will make the device very hard to use, unless you're just talking about weather resistance for outdoor use.  As with all projects of that nature, try to give them a little protection from the brunt of the rain force, but they will handle the splash back without a problem.What are the dimensions of the controller/dimmer?  The photo looks as if it is smaller than the remote. It is smaller than the remoteWhat are the dimensions of the controller/dimmer?  The photo looks as if it is smaller than the remote.

It was so cheap I didn't bother with a return.will this work with SUPERNIGHT LED Strip Light, 5M or 16.4ft, SMD 5050, Waterproof 300 LEDs? It matters what model you have.  This controller is for a single color led strip.  Example Cool white etc.   If your strip is RGB(multi color) it could work, but you would only be able to control one color, or control all colors to produce white light.will this work with SUPERNIGHT LED Strip Light, 5M or 16.4ft, SMD 5050, Waterproof 300 LEDs? It should operate with any 12v power supply and LED strip. As long as you don't exceed the 12A rating you should be fine. An FYI though, this product is extremely unreliable. I purchased 2 and they both didn't work.will this work with SUPERNIGHT LED Strip Light, 5M or 16.4ft, SMD 5050, Waterproof 300 LEDs? This will only work with mono colored Led strips. It will work with power adapters with 12V adapters needed for most led strips with a max of 12A.will this work with SUPERNIGHT LED Strip Light, 5M or 16.4ft, SMD 5050, Waterproof 300 LEDs? All the answers below mirror my experience.  Works with mono LED strip without a problem.  Bought another to control under cabinet lighting in my other house.will this work with SUPERNIGHT LED Strip Light, 5M or 16.4ft, SMD 5050, Waterproof 300 LEDs? should be fine with one strip assuming you are referring to a single color strip, not an RGB strip. I'd question it's ability to handle more than one length as that could be too much current. I wouldn't count on these to handle the full amperage they say they will ;)What batteries are in the remote?? Has anyone had to replace them yet and can say roughly what battery life the remote has?

Pairing a remote to a controller:1. Remove power from controller for at least 5 seconds2) Apply power to controller and within 5 seconds hold down both 100% and 25% keys for 5 secondsWhen this power is cut will the controller remember the last setting? Ex. Lights on 50% and when the power is back its also on at 50% again Yes, it will return to it's last mode.  RFI might be a problem if it's used close to an AM radio.  A capacitor on the output might be helpful.  Other than that, it works really nice.When this power is cut will the controller remember the last setting? Ex. Lights on 50% and when the power is back its also on at 50% again Yes, tried it on two different settings.Does the current draw go down as lights are dimmed or is the excess energy just dumped in the dimmer? It's really neither. The system works using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM - google it). Basically the LEDs are turned fully on and fully off fast enough that the eye can't see it.Does the current draw go down as lights are dimmed or is the excess energy just dumped in the dimmer? I'm not sure. There is a small device that is inline with the positive and negative 12v supply that regulates the voltage and can switch on and off power. I assume it is some sort of relay/potentiometer. I don't know where any excess power gets dumped, I think it's just not being used.", "summary": "Water-resistant: able to resist the penetration of water to some degree but not entirely.

Your sound card probably has something that simulates surround. Mine does. Very good headphones.Is there an inline mute for the mic? If you're using the USB, yes.  If you're using the headphone jack on your computer for them, no.Is there an inline mute for the mic? No, there are no inline controls.Is there an inline mute for the mic? Not natively, but it comes with a USB adapter that has a microphone mute button with an LED so you know when it's on or off.

Almost all VoIP programs have a push-to-talk feature, even Skype can be set to push-to-talk under the advanced settings in the hotkeys column.Is this headset worth the money ? as all the reviews i been seeing is it the best headset ? ill be using it for PC with ASUS Xonar Essence Stx? For flat and accurate sound it's up with the best. It's not the most ideal for bassy music but it will hit all the notes. The Xonar is good, these are only 32 ohm and can be powered by most sources.this or beyerdynamic dt 880? why? This headset is based on DT770. As far as music goes, it has a different sound signature than DT880. This headset will have more pronounced bass and recessed mids, while DT880 is the most neutral Beyer on this tier. If you want to read more, there's a great article on head-fi called \"Sonic Differences between DT770-DT990 models\": http://www.head-fi.org/t/513393/guide-sonic-differences-between-dt770-dt990-models-more . For gaming, this headset is likely to be more \"fun\" (immersive).this or beyerdynamic dt 880? why? The DT 880 doesn't have a mic, so if you have a decent external one, you should be covered. But personally I always prefer a full set. Their prices are almost the same, so I think you should go with gaming, IF you will use it as gaming headset.Do these headphones offer sidetone?

No and no.  These headphones only have standard audio jack connectors (3.5mm plug with a 1/4\" adapter).  All the \"smarts\", if any, will come from whatever this is plugged in to.Does this headset come with the USB Dac and also does it have Mic Monitoring?

It does lack features like mic mute when boom is up and on can volume controls.is there a better gaming headphone than this? or this is top of the line? To be honest, I can only answer subjectively, based on my research into the same question. I can say that, coupled with the Soundblaster ZxR, it is by far the best sounding headset I've found.is there a better gaming headphone than this? or this is top of the line? It's expensive.  For a closed headphone, it is good. I think it's pretty much the DT770 32ohm with an attached mic.  However, the mic itself leaves much to be desired for the price.  If I could do it over again, I'd get the DT770 32ohm and a modmic and save some $$ while getting a better mic.  Also, U.S. based customer support on Beyerdynamic headphones isn't that great.  Finally, since mine have gone out of warranty, while they still sound great, they are physically disintegrating.is there a better gaming headphone than this? or this is top of the line? I have had a lot of headiets and this is the best one yet. Paired with my creative zxr sound card I hear way more then I ever did before and they super comfortable. I would recommend to anyone who has the money to purchase.is there a better gaming headphone than this? or this is top of the line? I love my MMX300 everyone says that I'm clear and loud when I'm using them.

These will work with anything that outputs through a standard headphone jack.  That being said, these headphones sound best when used with a decent amplifier. Using just a headphone jack will allow for sound in your ears but the mic will require a dedicated mic jack in addition to the headphone jack to use the microphone.can this hook up to ps3? ps4? i have a monitor with headphone jack, that works?

A 1/4 or 3/8 drill or screw driver should be no problem.An industrial strength 1/2 drill or 3/4 HP drill press would probably be too much.With a vacuum cleaner it would depend on the size and horsepower. This is a 1000 watt generator--about 8 amps of power. any motor that draws more than 8 amps starting current would be too much load.Will it run a vacuum cleaner or power drill/screwdriver, etc? Yes as long as it doesn't draw much more than 8 amps or use over 1000watts it will run them.

Things like coffee makers, irons, and heaters will overload it and the limiter will cut the power.Will it run a vacuum cleaner or power drill/screwdriver, etc? The beat way to determine use is to look at the wattage of the tool (watts = Amps x volts). For the EF1000 it should not exceed about 800 watts. A typical vacuum cleaner uses about 1200 watts so it cannot be used. A power drill will use about 420 watts.

Other people mentioned the cities. While it does not teach specific history, it can open up a discussion regarding how one might build their city, concentrate on trade, or education, or war.

The game only requires you to tally up the score at the end of the game, after all the game moves were completed. This is more convenient to do in writing, but there's nothing during the game that needs to be \"remembered\" for later, and is one of the brilliant points of the game in my opinion. The game provides notes to write on so you can write on them at first.In any case, I found several nice mobile apps that allowed doing this without writing at all if you have nothing to write with but do have a smartphone/tablet.Does this game require writing in order to play?

It would be nice to sleeve them, does anyone know what size sleeves these need? The best sleeves are from Ultra Pro (http://amzn.com/B005CM80X0). The sleeves from Mayday Games are thinner, so they split easily if you try to shuffle the cards. Worse, the Mayday sleeves STICK to each other and you really have to double-check the cards when you sort them after a game. The Ultra Pro sleeves don't split and they don't stick. The only downside with the Ultra Pro sleeves is that they're a little bigger, so the cards don't easily fit in the storage slots in the box. They DO fit, but it's tight.Card sleeve size This game is getting a lot of play, especially the 3 - 5 player cards. It would be nice to sleeve them, does anyone know what size sleeves these need?

What's the best way to get a better set of rules so you start on the right foot? See the following video on You tube: \"7 Wonders Demo - BoardGameGeek Booth - Essen Spiel 2010\"", "summary": "While the product does have some history about the 7 wonders, I doubt it's considered educational. The game uses the seven wonders of the ancient world. They are the Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Garden of Babylon, Mausoleum of Helicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. The product is set in ancient times but there's nothing like magic or supernatural premises included with the game. Games in the range of 8 to 10 will be fine playing this game. The gameplay is interactive and the men and women are appropriately dressed. On average, the game takes around 30 minutes. That time varies based on who you are playing with and how long they take to make choices. Writing isn't necessary for this game. You are able to tally up the score at the end in your head if you wish. The instructions for the game can be downloaded from the games website. Here is the link: http://rprod.com/index.php?page=download-2 For this particular product, you can try the sleeves by Ultra Pro ((http://amzn.com/B005CM80X0). These are the ideal sleeves for the cards. Mayday sleeves are much thinner, stick to one another, and split easily when shuffling. The Ultra Pro sleeves won't have these issues. The downside to the Ultra Pro is that the cards don't fit perfectly and it can be a bit tight. If you want to use an outside source, there is a video on YouTube titled \"7 Wonders Demo - BoardGameGeek Booth - Essen Spiel 2010.\" The video should help you understand the rules of the game better.

If you already have the pilot hole drilled, then what is the hesitation about driving the lag bolt in? It will either go or it won't. If it only goes part way before the drill stops, then you can always finish driving it in with a box end wrench or socket wrench or drill the pilot hole to 7/16\" and try again.

This particular lense will take average distances from say 3-5\" (do not have the specifics) to scenery.

It does come loose so glue it or remove it tape the wood back down and wrap in para cord it's a great handle wrap done that way and won't slip or come loose if done rightWhat is the hilt wrapped with? It was wrapped with a spongy white wrap, now it's wrapped with paracord.What is the hilt wrapped with? It's wrapped with a cheap plastic ribbon that, on mine, was barely glued in place.  Under that is a black plastic ribbon that holds the \"scales\" on the sides on.  I removed the white plastic and wrapped the whole thing in paracord, and it's really comfortable.What is the hilt wrapped with? A leather like fabric. It's rather nice, but the glue isn't. After a month the wrapping came off, so I just used electrical tape to stick it back on.What type of Steel is it? 440 \"Surgical\" stainless steel. Well worth the money!What type of Steel is it? Low grade stainless steel most likely 420A it's alright for show peices and the sword itself is whippy but it can be sharpend and does cut descentIs it full tang? Dont buy it, its a piece of crap. The blade bends every time you use it and the handle falls apart eventually. But to answer you; it is full tang.Is it full tang? Yes it is, with the paracord wrap I put on it it looks sweet.Is it full tang? Sort of. Its two-part, with a thick weld between the bits. At least mine is, dunno if they're all like that. It's held up well to use in the woods on trail maintenance, for light vines and thorn bushes it works perfectly.Is it full tang? Yes, but the handle isn't excellent. The leather will likely come off.

It's ok it's really Howe you get it form them mine need work but worth itHow durable is the Blade? Will it need to be sharpened? Does it have a full tang? Hi Noah, this is a great sword with a full tang. The wrapping is not bead cord and sparsely wrapped, probably for looks. But the metal is strong, lots of carbon in it and it holds an edge much better than the cheap machete you can buy at Harbor Freight. For the price I couldn't beat it, now I am looking for some strong bead cord to wrap the handle.How durable is the Blade? Will it need to be sharpened? Does it have a full tang? Overall I was quite pleased with my blade, it is full tang, and it came with a good base edge. If you want it razor sharp you will have to sharpen it. My only problem with it is that the wrappings on the hilt were loose and if you actually use the blade, they shift up and down. I would reccommend doing what I did and removing the factory wrappings and replacing with leather wrappings.How durable is the Blade? Will it need to be sharpened? Does it have a full tang? It seems relatively durable and sharp, i've hacked into plywood with it with no problems but it isn't sharp enough to cut your finger if you run it along the blade. It is NOT full tang, if you unwrap the handle you can see where the handle and blade are welded together. The sheath is garbage but with some super glue it will last.Is this sharpened? If so, how sharp? its sharp but not so sharp that you can shave with itIs this sharpened? If so, how sharp? The tip is extremely sharp but the cutting surface is not sharp enough to cut paper.  Nonetheless when I applied a sharpening stone I found that it took and held the sharpening quite awhile.  Not bad for a very inexpensive sword with quite a bit too much of carbon.Is this sharpened? If so, how sharp? It is sharpened but not razor sharp, it has a decent edge.Is this sharpened? If so, how sharp? It is sharp, But I wouldn't use it to cut anything. its just basically a decoration.Is this sharpened? If so, how sharp? The one I received was sharpened, but not to a very keen edge.

Hope this helps. but it does not have a sink bowl drain stop lever. there are threads at the end of the spigot, but it comes with nothing.  H&m; is gallon per minute "}

Problem is leaking regardless how used.Can  you use it as a seat cushion too...Or wouldnt the valve hold the air? I bought the cushion as a back pillow and it provided the best relief ever, however it did develop a leak after about 5-6 months and therefore I would hesitate to use it as a seat cushion unless you don't mind replacing it more often as needed. Again, it does give great relief.Can  you use it as a seat cushion too...Or wouldnt the valve hold the air? It is not designed to be a seat cushion.  It would be uncomfortable.  The design is that it has only enough air in it to make it mold to your back.  In fact if you over inflate it, it is not comfortable on your back.

The 50mm tamper I bought on Amazon ended up being about 49mm, which is just slightly too small at the top of the basket. Though, it doesn't reach all the way to the bottom of the basket because of the angle of the side walls. The tamper stops right at the '2 cup' mark.  So, 49-50mm would be the best size to buy.  If you are ordering one online, go for the 50mm, because it will probably measure just under 50mm. 51mm might be slightly too big if you are trying to make under 4 servings of espresso.what size tamper is appropriate? You only need a tamper if you are making espresso. This machine is NOT espresso machine. However, it makes fantastic strong coffee.what size tamper is appropriate? I have a 49MM espresso tamper.

You can make a medium roast an espresso. Yes, most times, a dark roast may be used, but to taste the true harvest of a roast, one does not need to make an espresso with just dark roasts.

Thanks for the info.Can you fly 5 of these at the same time? A 2.4ghz radio is not like the old 60 channels RC. Yes, you can fly 5 at the same time because each radio \"binds\" to each receiver inside the helicopter. No two frequencies in the 2.4Ghz frequency are the same when it comes to binding.Can you fly 5 of these at the same time? I would think you would have to have 5 channels. Never thought about it but the remote and chopper probably have limited choices. Could be completely wrong.can not get the reciever and transmitter to bind or sync together Make sure you have the copter on a flat level surface and then make sure your controller throttle stick is at the absolute bottom of the dance for throttle, what until the unit binds and the lights stop flashing and you will hear a beep. You are all set and binded to the controller , ready for flying!can not get the reciever and transmitter to bind or sync together Although I read about this sort of thing from some other reviewers, I did not have this problem.  I added the charged batteries, turned it on, and it worked.  I don't know if there's a remedy other than exchanging the product.  Sorry.Is the single propeller harder to fly then the dual propeller yes. there is a learning curve involved. Once you learn you will never fly a dual prop ever again.Is the single propeller harder to fly then the dual propeller Single Blade Heli's seem to have better control, but they take some getting use to, and also some forgiving smacks. But they react a lot better than a dual pro. Now this is only my opinion. I have several of both, and prefer the single. Hope this helps.Is the single propeller harder to fly then the dual propeller Yes, but the single blade isn't too bad.Is the single propeller harder to fly then the dual propeller I don't know because it was Dead On Arrival.  The radio would not light up with fresh batteries in it and neither would the chopper after charging for 48 hours.  Nothing would work.  I ended up getting one locally made by World Tech Toys.  It operates on 49 MHz RF so you can fly it farther up and away from your position.  It is built a lot tougher than the one pictured here.  You can even fly the World Tech Toys chopper outside in calm wind.how long do the batteries last Each battery will last 5 to 7 minutes it will take 10 to 15 minutes to charge the batteriesShoul i buy new version battery or old version for this heli? The new version of this heli will ONLY accept the new batteries. They completely changed the battery compartment design to work with the newest model. These snap in, the old ones hung by a strap.Can it fly outside? Yes but better have practice its a more touch outside due to windCan it fly outside? it can, but mine broke after a week. the controller is very delicateCan it fly outside? yes,suredoes this heli have led lights for night flying Yes one red led,but beware of qualitydoes this heli have led lights for night flying No but it is fun to fly", "summary": "Thank you for the information. You can fly 5 of these at a time since each radio binds to the receivers but remember that the frequencies can't be the same when it comes to binding.

Once that happens it's time to fly. The single propeller is more difficult to fly. Each battery is going to last 5 to 7 minutes and take 10 to 15 minutes to charge. You should buy the new version battery for this helicopter as the new version only accepts new batteries. The battery compartments design has been changed as the batteries snap in instead of hanging by a strap. Flying outside is fine but make sure you have a good amount of practice as wind can make it more difficult. The helicopter has one red LED light but the quality isn't the best. "}

I don't have the box which might tell the lumens.

Not very bright but works ok in my closet.How long does it keep working before it breaks (LED fails etc.)?  How many months or years? It has worked continuously for over a year at which time the sensor seems to have weakened and you have to be closer then the normal setting to get it to trigger the light.  Light does still work.How long does it keep working before it breaks (LED fails etc.)?  How many months or years? I have had mine a few months works well but have already gone through 4 sets of batteries. Might be more cost effective to buy an electrical unit at this rate it's gotten pretty expensive, because it takes 4 c batteries.How long does it keep working before it breaks (LED fails etc.)?  How many months or years? I have had mine for a few mths.  Haven't replaced the batteries yet.  But I use mine for my chicken house so they are triggering it.  The light sensor is still pretty good right now.  Although I do also see a tad bit difference.  Right now I still reccommend it.  Enjoy yours.What is the battery life? Its been going strong since April. And keep it out of the rain.What is the battery life? Depends on how often it is activated. It runs on 4 C batteries. I've had two outdoor ones in for over a year and have not replaced the batteries yet. The light will be dimmer as the battery power fades. It shouldn't just abruptly stop. Hope this helps.What is the battery life? mine is outside for my porch light and I was thinking it was a year or two before I needed new batteries. It had snow and rain on it too!   A lot longer than I expected, so am very happy with the purchase.  Also since it's motion sensored, would also depend on how much it's activated.What is the battery life? I imagine that would depend on the quality of the replaceable batteries that you select to install and how often your light comes on when an object sets it off.  The light only stays on for a very short space of time when the person or animal moves out of range. I consider it one of my better buys.What is the battery life? Mine has had excellent battery life.  Still havent changed the batteries and its one of the best motion sensing lights I haveWhat is the battery life? Mine sits out in the rain & snow & cold (central North Dakota!) and the batteries have lasted over a year and a half.  It sits on a flat rock in the flowerbed at the corner of the house.What is the battery life? Have been using all five of mine on the original batteries for the last 14 months. Still going strong.What is the battery life? I haven't had to change the batteries yet and the light doesn't get that all that much use since I have it outside over a shed door opening.  I've had the light since early in the summer so it's been approx. 4 months.  Sorry I'm not more help.What is the battery life? 10 Years  That is the Life of the battery but how long it lasts being Used I do not Know. The LED Light is supposed to last for 2400 Hrs.How long will the light stay on? The light stays on as long as it detects movement and it is dark. Once movement is no longer detected, it takes about 20 seconds or so to shut off.How long will the light stay on? I gave these to my parents as a gift. They use them to light up the driveway since they cannot run electric under the cement. I have not timed it but they stay on as long as your in front of them. They are motion lights and Even after I pull down the driveway when I leave they are still on.How long will the light stay on? Mine stays on for 30 seconds after motion ceases.How long will the light stay on? After about 45 seconds of no movement it goes offWhat does 100 degrees detection angle mean? 360 degrees is a full circle, 180 is 1/2, so 100 degrees is a portion of that circle.  Think of a \"wide\"  triangle within a 1/2 circle.What does 100 degrees detection angle mean? I'm not good with geometry, but I'll try to answes.  Think of a circle having 360 degrees,thus 180 in a half circle.  100 degrees is the size of a goof sized slice if pie.How weatherproof is this light? The LED light and sensor panel are well sealed from outdoor moisture.  The battery cover is removable and can't be sealed, but does have a close fit.  It may be wise to check the battery terminals for cleanliness when you change batteries.  The terminals can be cleaned with WD-40 and Isopropyl alcohol.  The WD-40 removes tarnish and corrosion then the alcohol removes the WD-40.How weatherproof is this light? I had it over my garage door and the 1st night it rained, water got into the battery compartment and motion sensor. I put it in a bowl of rice for a few days and it got most out to the point to where it would work again. I put a sealant around anywhere that i thought water could get in and it's been great ever since.  It just doesnt look the greatest lol. So to answer your question, it isnt weather proof unless you make it that way. Hope i helped.How weatherproof is this light? I had this light out in the Pennsylvania rain and snow all year and it works like a dream.How weatherproof is this light? I put it under the eave of my mom's house and in about 2 months she said it didn't work too well. I took it down and it was all corroded up inside where the batteries go. Not sure what caused this but I put new batteries in it and it didn't come on, so I cleaned on it a little more and it still wouldn't work...so I tossed it. I don't think I'll buy another one. BTW she lives in Southwest VA. near TN./VA. line, so I don't think wet weather is an issue in this instance. They may have improved them now as this was over a year ago.RKGHow weatherproof is this light? Well, I have three.   One is inside a 7x7x7 refrigerated cooler as an emergency light should there be a power failure or some clown turns off the power -- works fine.   The other two are outside but under an overhang.   They do not get direct hits from rain but they do get the \"weather\" -- works fine.   They seem well built enough to take direct hits from water, essentially they're a glorified flash light with very little that can go wrong.
