AnAn adapter is not needed for an i-pod. These headphones are best used for listening to music on portable players. For recording, you'd usually want headphones in the "monitor" category that give you a very neutral sound and that completely block out outside noise. The audio mike for cell phone use works on android/motorola phone. This headphone plugs into the green audio port on the computer. The sound quality depends on music type. Electronic music sounds real nice.
There is no hinged door. The center of the tent is over 6' 6", the door opening is roughly 6' when on level ground. This has a rain cover. This tent has a small zipper opening in two corners so you can bring in electricity on either side. Which gives a lot of relief to knowing you don't have to put electricity location as a top priority when deciding where the best ground is to set up the tent. It's about 14 X 10. With room to walk upright in every inch of that space. It really does have a fan but it's not very powerful. You can
The heatsink comes with some already applied. This product can run high quality games, but depends on your memory and video card or cards. This chip requires an AM2 CPU. DDR3 and DDR2 are supported separately. This motherboard will allow you to use AM2 with DDR2, or AM3 with DDR3, but you can't mix them. Always match your cpu socket. Am3 + is your current motherboard socket. This is an "AM3" motherboard. The processor requires an
The black plastic liner fits snuggly inside the stainless shell.  Obviously, it's a 13 gallon container.  It lifts completely out of the can.  Pulling the liner out and carrying it around the house to collect trash from other areas is A LOT easier than carrying the whole can. Easy in, easy out... easy in again. The Freshener System means a refillable air freshener cartridge you change out. The dimensions are roughly 16" by 10" about 21" deep.  If something is stinky in the can you can smell it when the top is open, but you
The lightning connection is for the iPhone 5. This dock does not have a lightning connection. This product does not include an AM/FM radio. However, it will happily play the audio from a terrestrial or Internet radio app on your docked or AUX-connected device. The dock connector on the new iPhones is not compatible without a converter. The player has the 30 pin connector. You will need an adaptor. The product does work with the 4S and you won't be disappointed with the sound-magnificent! The product is not really a portable unit. Well, it could be, but you'd get
This product is specifically made for the Jeep JK. This product will fit the 2014 Jeep Wrangler. This item will not fit the 2013 4 door JK because Jeep has not changed the latches on the 2007-2014 model Jk's. This will fit your 2013 Jeep Wranger, 2 door or 4 door. This is a basic socket and alien wrenches is all that's needed. This package contains two complete hood latches, (left and right side) as well as washers and the nuts needed for install on both sides of the hood of the vehicle. The spread of the nut on this product is
This product is perfect for the office. This product does not have any controls on the headphones/cord for anything. The neckband is flexible. The driver unit is a decent speaker for its price. The only downside of the headphones is that they slip of easily. These headphones are very comfortable, even for someone like myself who has a rather large neck (sz 18). No ear pinching at all. The cord is about four feet in length. The size of the ear pads is 2 inches. The headset is designed to go around the neck and not over the head, an adjustment for the head size is really
This product has an AMD Quad-Core A8-4500M Accelerated Processor 1.9GHz with TurboCORE Technology up to 2.8GHz. This product is able to run SimCity smoothly and without issues. This unit accepts both CDs and DVDs. The RAM in this laptop is 4gb ddr3. The hard drive can be upgraded depending on how much idle time you have. The screen is more glossy than matte, not bad though. This should do the work Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse This product accepts CDs or DVDs. This
The Collector's edition doesn't include Diablo 3. You should buy it separately. The Reaper of Souls includes all four acts from D3 along with the new fifth act. This game has a Spanish Leguage. The angel wings were on offer for a limited time when you registered the expansion shortly after release. The limited edition has special angelic and demonic transmogrification plans as well as one for death. The angels wings come with the pearl edition... The first... the Diablo III: Collector´s Edition Yes, you need internet conection all the time no matter you playing alone. But its a great game. Yes
This bag is small and could be used for a camelback for water. It's a lot smaller than it looks. This bag could fit some text books but very few. A 20l bag would be better. This pack is smaller than a normal backpack and the straps come loose when there is too much weight. It has one that is workable but it is one of the very few drawbacks about this pack. Fits close, good and tight...hope this helps Ryan!!� Can it hold a laptop? Maybe up to a 13".  Wouldn't go any larger. Not very large hunting tools just simple.
This product has a Twist Knob by the bulb. This product is 19 inches tall from the base of the lamp to the top of the shade. The lamp shade is approximately 9 inches tall and has a 5 inch opening at the top and 12 inch opening in the bottom. The base of this lamp is made of some kind of plastic. This lamp is a smaller type lamp similar to a table lamp only smaller. It looks loads better with different colored seashells in it. The dimensions of this product are 21-1/2" high and 11" wide at the base. The height of the product is about 20
The wine aerator does not use a filter. The main problem is that residual wine will drip from the aerator into the holding cup, so you have to clean everything after each use. The aerator is made of acrylic. Even less expensive wines will taste great.  Rinse as you go, and you'll have no problems! This or the Vinluxe? Amazon rates them both very high. Both have the same 3 stage process for aeration. Umbrella, tiny holes and then the suction tube. From an engineering standpoint they appear to be the same.
This product is a straight edge blade. This product comes with a sheath and a molle clip. The product is made in the USA. The knife is very large and heavy but it is an excellent knife. The blade edge is smooth. The screws can be removed to place the clip on either side. This is from the factory in Oregon. Check the outside of the box the knife came in (not the shipping box but the blue/black/gold benchmade box). If its legit it will have a barcode on one of the sides. This knife is 8 inches long and 7 inches wide. This blade is
This mailbox is durable in hot south Texas weather and still looks good. This mailbox is very well made and looks new. The mailbox is 7 1/2 by 8 inches width and height and 18 inches deep. A string line trimmer won't damage it. The post is not completely covered. There is a small amout on the lower back that is not covered. If mailman would put something to big to pop open back door things could get blown out but no problem so far.  The 44 pressure treated mailbox is almost the same color as the front of the house but the back is not. The
This product will not go in sand as it needs a level, hard surface. The wire basket lifts easily off of two hooks before folding the rear wheels together. This product weighs about 15 pounds and can be easily handled up and down stairs. The basket is removed before you close the walker so that you can put it in the back of your vehicle. The wheels are big enough, but just walking on sand, can be a bit more 'pressing'. This product is removable and has snaps on each side. The bag is 30" wide and has a clearance of 1.5". This product can pass through the thresholds
This product is made in China. This product does a great job at straining a fine powder of tea leaves. The 5" includes a solid band around the top enclosing the mesh securely. The seeds would stay in the strainer. It might be fine enough though, that the puree might struggle to get out. The screen is small enough to retain particles up to very small size, so it will eliminate those. A chinois has a larger capacity and is stronger, so that materials can be pushed down without concern for damaging the vessel. But not as heavy duty as one you would find in a professional kitchen.
This product does not come with a cable to connect it to an amp. This product is only 120V. The connection options are single RCA jack and a mediabridge subwoofer cable. This sub is not a good match with a Yamaha RX-v475. There is a switch in the back and a light in the front which shows on or off. There's a button behind that you need on and off. The 120V AC input is used for. It is always on, never turns off. It will not
The switch for the reading light is on the top of the light. The reading lamp has a switch on the globe, as does the room lamp. This is *NOT* CA (California) compliant. Not a typo. This lamp is UL Listed which means it has past a quality test. The highest wattage of the bulb you can put in the reading lamp 40 to 60 watts is not bright enough 60 watt or 13W max. CFL bulb is the highest you can use. The only question is which one you'll want to use -- they don't all cast light as uniformly or with the same color
You can use disposable specula with this model. Disposable specula are available at WWW.otoscopespecula.com. The light is a light emitting diode- LED with a voltage of 3-3.4 volts DC. The LED has no makings, so if you need a replacement, either contact or take a chance on-line. The base, where you put specula, has standard size and you can buy any additional to use. There are some small specula in the set. The ophthalmoscope is also low power. Power is two standard C batteries.
This product will not work on an induction cook-top. The very easiest way to to to tell if a pan will work is to see if a magnet will stick to the bottom. If it does, it will work with induction burners. This product does not have a non stick surface on the inside. To drain you would have to hold slightly open and hope not to lose too much content with the liquid. The outside color of the pan is shiny stainless steel which stays shiny and is easy to clean. Outlet stores used to sell sets and individual items. K-Mart also carries this pan on their website
Apple 40pin connector to USB, only Apple mobile devices up to 4thgendoes this work with Samsung SIII Really? You're asking if an "Apple" product works on a Samsung???? They didn't work at all.this is an early generation APPLE ONLY cable. Don't buy these they r cheap and they broke within a few uses! This cable is about 3 inches if you need it to charge an apple device it will not work it connects the device to radio computer ect but iPod or iPhone don't support it. The entire unit is 4.7 inches. If the original apple cable fits then this
The unit itself is 'passive' with respect to pairing. If your input source has only a single device in its pairing list it will automatically pair with the Fusion. But if you have multiple devices in your Bluetooh list, like I do on my IPhone, you will need to choose it each time you power it on. The skip ahead feature on the Fusion does not seem to work. Of course volume works from the Fusion and it auto mutes for a phone call so that is kind of neat. This unit is only for transmitting music from your phone to the radiocan you make calls with this?
This product will not fit your vehicle. This kit will fit your 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis. This product comes with two coil spring isolators not four. The switch in the trunk must be left ON when you are finished the installation on later models because the switch affects the Power Steering Sensors. The product does come with Sensatrac shocks. The instructions tell you how to disengage the Rear Suspension light. This will not work on a 99 Olds Bravada because the coils replace the air bags. This item will work with a 2000 Lincoln Towncar. The item comes with 2 springs and two struts.
This case doesn't have a hand strap because of material but the grip is perfect. This case will fit any of the ipad mini's. The description says "designer leather" which sounds like yet another plastic byproduct. there is no stamp indicating "leather" - it is however very convincing if it is not real - the inside is extremly smooth, and has a texture of embossed leather, the outside of the cover has a nice texture and has natural look to it with varied texture - the band/buckle piece is leather, it is visable on the underside of the buckle band.
This product is made of solid wood and is quite sturdy. You could buy a tray for this kind of chair, but these are made to be pushed up to a table. The height of the arms is 27 inches from the floor to the top. The bar in front of the chair is 26 1/2 inches high. The distance from the chair back to the bar is 9.25 inches. This product slides under the table just fine. The chair tip over if the child moves around or tries to stand in the chair. This chair is sturdy and has a seat belt. This is the same chair many restaurants use
The folded width of the bed is 14 inches. The bed is easy to fold in 15 seconds, and you can lock it. The wheels work fine. This bed is very easy to store. If you have a bulky comforter on top, you may have to remove it first before folding the bed. The dimensions of this bed are 42 inches tall, 38 inches wide and 44 inches tall. The slats are made of wood. The mattress is made of polyester and is 7.5" wide and 62". This bed has enough support for an adult. The sheets are made from a polyester sheet and
The USB 3.0 bus provides enough power for most small laptop drives and SSDs, but larger desktop hard drives and optical drives will require the external AC Adaptor, which comes included with the device. The chipset is in the adapter. According to their documentation online....ASMedia 1051E chipset Works great, works great, no drivers needed. This will show up just as it would if you connected it to an internal header. This is just a hardware connector to plug your HDD to a USB port. So whatever else you want to do with the contents of the drive will have to be software driven. It doesn't
This product shoots around 850-900 FPS with 22 cal pellets. This air rifle is made in China. This product has a.177 caliber. The air rifle comes with a scope that is made for air rifles. This item has enough power to penetrate a 1/16" sheet of galvanized steel. The best scope for this air rifle depends on your personal preference. Rick Utsler on youtube has suggestions for scope. This combination of rifle and scope will take out just about anything you point it at and it depends on what kind of pellet you use just be safe. The gun is heavy and very powerful. This
This product is not a camera. Purchase two and connect them in SLI mode. That way, you can take both around, connected by a ribbon cable, and shoot photos/videos in 3D. The fan on this thing is pretty excellent. After a 2 hour long BF4 session the fan can cool from 75c+ down to about 35-40c in 2-3minutes. This card blows the hot out the back, correct?! Thanks! The actual length of this card from the mounting bracket to the back of the card (the actual part that occupies the inside of the computer) is 10.5 inches
The height from floor to top of the shade is 60 inches (5 ft) and the height is not adjustable. The lampshade is attached by squeezing in the 2 spindle type things and setting them in the slots and sliding a little cover down over them. This is very strudy and stable. Should not be a problem with most cats, unless yours is a heavyweight and/or athlete :-) The height is about 5 ft tall. This lamp is made in China and is very similar to the Kichler 8655AB fixture. The diameter of the bottom is 12.6 inches (32 cm).
This reduced sodium count is 940 mg in 1 TBIs this reduced Sodium usually the Silver lables are Yes, the label says "Reduced Sodium" on the front. Even so, there are 700mg of sodium in a one tablespoon serving. This is a wheat/Gluten free soy sauce and is not low sodium. These products also dairy free. This has lactic acid, which I believe is dairy derived.  By Sunshine! Yes, it is dairy-free! These products are made from non-GMO soybeans. Any label that has "Organic" means non GMO. This
The turntable contains a built in switch between phono and line. You should connect it to the "Phono" input and select "phone". You can do a quadraphonic setup on the receiver to play four speakers. You will have to set the system to 4 Ohms to evenly distribute the power which is recommended by Onkyo. You can turn both A and B on at the same time for a setup you describe, although it won't be actual surround, as this is a stereo receiver that only supports left/right, not 5.1 or 7.1 surround This unit is high
The Polarized visor is mounted as instructed. Pull it down from the car visor just about half-way, and then push it all way forward towards the windshield (if the polarized visor was still folded up, it would actually be on top of the car. There won't be any gap. Polarizing filters are for reflected light. If you are going to drive during hours of low direct sunlight you will need a dark shade filter in addition to this products. The tint is polarized. It is very effective in reducing Sun glare. The pins that hold it on don't spread apart. The velcro straps secure
This kettle performs even better than it looks Yes, you can leave the whistle flipper up. Pushing the spout lever down will lock the whistle up. Probably 6 or so. It holds a lot of water. If you fill it too full it will spit some water out. It's a 2-quart kettle, so 6-8 cups of tea, I think - you lose some water to the leaves and it depends on how big and how full your cups are The pot size is 2 quarts, so it really depends on the size of your cups.  It can make 4 (8 ounces) cups of
You can transfer calls from the headset, if you go into settings and enable the feature to do so. Choose option #3. This unit can be used with a regular landline or VoIP system. This product has a mute feature available via double tapping the earpiece or tapping mute on the touchscreen. Most importantly does that device have a plug on the back for a headset. This is because Jabra PRO™ 9400 uses an enhanced version of the DECT standard, thereby enabling many of its advanced call-handling features. These enhancements are not supported by third-party manufacturers. You can only pair the headset with
This product comes with just the tent and bag. Heavy rain will collect and bow the top so you'll have to be careful to knock the water off the top. This product is made of a thick wind-breaker sort of synthetic fabric. This tent is not for use in the rain, or heavy dew. It would take a long time with one person. 2 people though--its fast and decently easy! This tent has 4 height adjustments. A 6 foot man can get under it without ducking. This is the best product. It will stand up to a heavy down pour. At the lowest part
The power gets connected at the DVR side. All you need is a power outlet next to your DVR. This camera has color during the day when there is sufficient light, but at night it's black and white (night vision mode). Great camera though! I have two of them, and they have been working flawlessly for six months and counting. No software included as this would usually be an add-on to an existing system. This cam has no mic for audio. This product can be used on the night owl lite dvr Yes it can, the camera connection is BNC so it is a straight
The unit doesn't support double ended bits. The owners manual tells you it isn't designed to accomodate double ended bit. The unit is quite lightweight. Weighs around 14 oz. It doesn't have variable speed. Also does not have an adjustable clutch as described. Very short time less than an hour is good enough to put to work. The battery life is pretty impressive. It recharges in about 4 to 6 hours depending on how far the battery is drained before plugging it in. It comes with a charging cord that plugs into the bottom of the handle. The motion switch is located on top of
The slicer will work on hash browns and thin sliced for creamed potatoes. The blades are really sharp, so should be able to. There isn't a separate lid to store grated cheese in the refrigerator. After the cheese is grated it would need to be stored in another container, preferably air tight. This blades are stainless steel. They are holding up well under use. The mandoline blade is devilishly sharp. My wife cut off the tip of her finger the first time she used it and we ended up in the ER to stop the bleeding. If you let your kiddies use your carpenter
This product comes with stakes to anchor it to the ground. The weight limit is 100 lbs per user and 500 lbs total. Anything above that makes the slide become unstable for others. The power cord should be 25 feet longhow long is power cord for pump The cord is maybe 30 feet long. This product is a big box, apx. 4x3x3 ft, its big and its heavy, 2 person to lift it. Easier to move then you think and comes in one big box with two smaller boxes inside. The shipping dimenssions are 20" x 20", x 3.5
The manual says 120 household power.  In order to use in a 240 volt environment, you will need to use a proper voltage converter.  b&d l2afcbst lithium- fast charger charge  20v lbxr20 battery Yes it's a fast charger *******  work with any B&D; 20V Lithium Ion battery   charger take about 30 minutes for a full charge for a standard 20V battery. 30 to 40 minutes The booklet says "The charger is designed to operate on standard household electrical power (120 volts).  Do not attempt to use it on any other voltage."
The thumb stud is on both sides of the blade. The flipper can be used with either hand. The blade does need to be sharpened often under hard daily use. 8Cr13MoV is a high-grade stainless steel that is slightly softer than AUS-8 (itss most comparative steel, some say). With a good diamond sharpener, I've found that the blade sharpens fast, and stays sharp under normal/moderately extreme use, from breaking down cardboard boxes to carving sandstone (though highly possible, the latter use is not a good use for any knife). Try the Smith's
This will definitely be a tight squeeze. Try to borrow from a store and see if it fits. It is pretty wide, see if you can't measure your trunk then the stroller bars/width. It pulls down further than most other push-chairs but not all the way. It can't be wheeled when folded and it is pretty heavy. You can also remove the wheels fairly easily which is good for long-term storage or to make it more compact. This is possible to fully pull down the canopies so the sun close to sunset doesn't distract babies but it can't cover their whole bodies
This is a powder coating which is different than just painting. It's process that bonds the coloring to the metal so it doesn't chip or peel later. After two years it still is. The weight capacity 325 lbs. This is not low, it is similar height to a bar chair/stool. The height of the seat is 25 inches, hope this helps. The chair is perfect for my six foot husband! His feet have to rest on the foot strap on bottom. The canvas sling is 20 inches and the inside arm rest is 21 1/2. The distance from the ground to the seat
This stapler can be used for 5/8" engineered flooring with adjustments for depth. This gun will not take cleats. This is a workhorse on flooring. It can do both. Groove and tounge. For the money this thing is dialed in. And 18g staple can be bought anywhere. The Freeman 4-In-1 Mini Flooring Nailer is for Tongue and Groove Flooring From 1/4" - 1/2", Cabinet Backing and Shoe Molding applications. This will be best fastened with a staple.
They are fixed at a 46 degree sharpening angle (23 degrees per side).See the blog @ http://www.edgeexperts.com/2010/12/21/2-step-knife-sharpener-sharpening-big-game-hunting-knives/ It is 2.4 inches tall. 2.70 inches wide. It is 7/8 inches thick. This sharpener works amazingly well, and can take off a visible amount of blade, so sliding it toward the tip from the handle and following thru until the sharpener is off the blade can dramatically reshape the tip. This
The tilt may be adjusted left or right to accommodate a left handed shooter. Instructions are included with the unit. The HHS l is night vision compatible and it's only a few dollars more. The number after the dash is the reticle configuration. - 0 is single dot, -2 is two dot. The magnifier flips to the right allowing the use of iron sights thru the en tech in either on or off position. The holographic and magnifier sights separate and just come in a bundle, but  its 2 separate units.
The straws for the 24 oz tumblers are 12" long. The straws are 10 inches if you don't stretch out the bendy part. When completely stretched out, it adds another inch or so. The diameter of the straws is appox 3/8" This product does not come with the cap with ring. This product is meant for the tall Tervis cups so are around 11-12" They are dishwasher safe on the top rack. The top is accordion style. These are not smooth and not "accordian"-style. They are only accordian near the top.
This product is made of 4116 German stainless. This product comes with a secure -ex sheath. The blade is made from Krupp 1.4116 steel and is very easy to sharpen. The handle is built over the full tang. This knife is a high carbon blade, so it will require some maintainence but nothing too extreme. Just keep it dry when not in use. This tanto does have the protective coating to prevent rust, but a light coat of oil can't hurt, especially if u live in a high humidity area or long term storage.  Good luck.

This product will work with the adapter for the Glock 42 sold by MGW. This product can be used to install Trijicon HD Night Sights for the 17, 19, and 21 Glocks. The double-ended tool will work to install the TruGlo front sight on the Glock 17. The front sight tool is very easy to use. The Truglo TFO sights are not designed for this job but with a little imagination it can be done. This tool will install Meprolight Glock Tru-Dot night sights on a Glock 19. They look simular to the trijicon night

This product plugs into a 120VAC socket. The feeding voltage is 110. This product is good for jump starting as long as you are jump starting it with a battery in your car and near a power outlet to plug this in. This is for use with 6 and 12 volt batteries. 12 volt is the highest it can do. It will charge the battery just fine. You may need to replace the clamps on the end of the charging cables. They are pretty poor quality, but other than that, it should work. The cables are 8 gauge and 6 feet in length. This Schumacher Wheeled Starter/
This product will not flow enough power to turn the starter over as main current provider. This tool will inject ground and voltage into any 12 volt DC system. You hook this up to the vehicle battery and can use it to apply + voltage to whatever you can touch with the tip of the probe. Don't try try to use the Power Probe to bypass the solenoid and jump between the large cables! This is a 12 volt device - don't try to power it with 110.

This product is 2 1/2" x 2-1/2. This product rings for only about 30 seconds and then turns off. The clip is sturdy enough to wear around the house.

The iPad air (or 5th gen iPad) is a little smaller than the iPad 4. The Universal version is adjustable and can hold the iPad Air/Air 2. The iPad's are currently out of stock and have been replaced with an etch-a-sketch. Maybe, but the air will be pretty rank. Mah Jong works very well on the toilet because there is a zen compatibility with the squares of toilet paper, and your chi will easily center.

The ones i received seems long. Change Stylus instead of using a stylus can you just put another ink cartridge in. The barrel metal with rubberized grip part. Yes, the pen is all metal and has quite a bit of heft to it. It has a nice, solid look and feel. It does not seem to be able to be removed but imo it won't interfere with your usage. Fisher's actually have break-away sections for different lengths, and you use the shortest. Refills have to be special "multi-point" refills. They are shorter and the diameter of
The pad is abrasive. The Casabella Flex Neck is good for cleaning the bath tub and the old fashioned porcelain wall tiles. Search for the sponge mops. The sponge attaches to the holder (very well) with a Velcro like backing. It curves and bends but it does take quite a bit of pressure to get it to bend when it is new. Once you break it in it will be much more flexable. It works on the whole shower inclosure and the tub, the long handle has the reach that I need these days to do a good job. This product is safe for porceline

The N62FNK-2 does have a light. The fold-out 16" center finder is invaluable when doing baseboard and crown molding. The gun can be used to build wood fences from 6' to 8' Cedar.

Baker's cut the weight in half and kept the PRICE fixed which DOUBLED the cost per ounce Baker's is simply the BEST baking chocolate I've ever used, especially in the silky way it melts.

This product is made of plastic. This product will fit a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 as long as it isn't a sport mode. This grill doesn't come with any bolts or retainers or anything.

This product requires drilling wholes into your safe. You have to attached the rack to the top lip of the door using self taping screws. The screws keep the rack from sliding around or falling off. This is a pistol rack (holds pistols) only. Not worth buying though, too costly for the purpose. Needs to be taken back to the drawing board in my opinion. The color of the outside of the cabinet is black. The Rack EM The Maximizer 8 pistol is not the safe, it is the gun rack that you see hanging inside of the safe door on the right. The rack itself can be

This pump might work for mouthwash but it's too big and awkward to pick up easily. This product could hold shampoo and soap in the shower but the dispenser would be slick, it is a clear hard acrylic/plastic, so only if you could stand it on something solid. This one has just the right amount that comes out and it helps to conserve by taking three or four pumps. Customers have been using it daily for about three months so far. No leaks and easy to use and fill. Looks classy and clean on our counter. This is a terrific dispenser with enough weigh to be very stable and easy
This lens takes a 62 mm front filter. This lens is the equivalent of 35mm on a full frame digital or film camera (not 50mm), and the fixed focal length built into the Fuji X100 and X100S. You can also check all lens specs at the fujifilm website. This is the most versatile prime XF lens.  14mm is too wide. 35mm a bit too close (remember it's actually closer to 50mm when you take into account the cropped sensor).  23mm is a bit more flexible as well as being a great lens. It's tack sharp even at

This product can dock the Ipad Mini. This product extends in the back but not much further out. Appears thinner than the old version but definitely still not flat or flush in back. There is a secondary piece that sticks out approximately 1.25 inches that you can't see in the provided view. This will work with the new iPhone 6 Plus. The only problem would be that if you use a case that is too thick so as to prevent good contact. This is compatible with iphone 5s but you cannot have a case on it.

Two prongs. It works fine, it's just not the same one as in the picture. The electric plug is about or nearly 6'-0" long... The cord is about 6 feet long.  You will need to start it.  This heater is UL safe and has its own ground-fault plug. It is safe for bathroom use as well. The heater is not "whisper quiet" but for me the noise level is acceptable. This heater has an ALCI-safe plug.

The saw comes with a very nice Bosch Blade. The saw comes in peices (the saw, the cutting platform and all of the splash gaurds). So if you unload the box and carry the parts up separately then yes, probably, depending on how strong you are.  Otherwise no, the box is too heavy and big for one person to carry. It would be better to have a helper carry the light side as first person going up, they coukld hold with one hand. And throw in stairs....sounds like a backache waiting to happen, phone a friend for help is

If you want it between your aero bars probably not, you want something like the ZIPP mount. Work with all of the quarter-turn Edge models: 200, 500, 510, 800, 810, 1000. This mounting bracket is simply a copy.
The measurement on the description is incorrect. The height and depth must have been added together. This lamp measures 60 1/2 inches to the top of the shade. This was easy to assemble. Love it.

Height of shade is 11 and one half inches. The lamp is a swing arm. We love it! Worth every penny.:) The height of the table without light fixture,
This cattle can be used on a gas stove as long as you butcher them first. This kettle was designed specifically for use on gas stove. There is a patent number and a "Traditional English Tea Kettle" mark stamped on the bottom. This tea kettle is designed to work properly on a glass, wood or coal flame.

This one with the holes and coils in the bottom is made for a gas top. There's another model
The cabinet dimensions were not quoted when the cabinet was sold to to me. It is only approximately 24 inch wide 24 inch hight and 1 feet in depth. Too expensive for its size.

The interior shelf is NOT removable and there is 9in between the shelf. The shelf is stationary and cannot be moved at all. The way this has been stained gives it a very european olde world look.

At least an 800 watt amp. it can if you wire it right. you can power it of a pro audio amp if you have one of those but if not then you could wire it off a car amp but car amps only run on 12v DC. you probably won't get that trunk rattling bass. But you'll get bass good enough for the inside of the car. Bigger is always better really but these subs have a 700 watt RMS so it should work OK. You should be okay with that. Just be sure not to overpower it or you will blow the sub. Boss 800 Watt amp. Or

The table surface does not fold at any point, as you said the legs fold up under the table and is very secure. The table comes assembled. This is a very sturdy product and should serve you well.

Otherwise table is awesome though hard at times to ignite. It is beautiful! You have to use an LP tank, or can you plumb it
The phone works with tmobile but only up to 3G network. Unlocked phones basically work with any prepaid sim card by any mobile brand or carrier. When referred to as " UNLOCKED " it means that the phone isn't straight talk now has sims cards for unlocked cell phones. Straight talk SIMs at this point only use the T-mobile network. Straight Talk sould work in 900 or 2100 (blu vivo 4.3 D910i). But if Straight Talk does not work in the frecuency for the 3G but instead in 850 or 1900 you should purshase the Blu
The handles are 20", just slightly larger than the average toilet tank. The handle bar width when installed is 20 inches - it screws on tightly (but need to check and make sure it's tight - otherwise it can shift if you put more weight on one handle bar than the other). It worked very well for me when recuperating from hip replacement. The original toilet seat and/or lid need to be removed in order to install this. The seat easily fits and locks on the toilet. There is a knob to tighten it. Easy to use. Once seated properly on your toilet it is 4 1/2
This product mounts with 2 screws that are provided. The flashing light activited by motion or does it always flash. The clear plastic dome can be removed from base to allow for insertion of the battery. The VideoSecu Fake Dummy Imitation Dome Security Camera can be mounted horizontally or vertically. The most practical application would be horizontal on the ceiling in a corner. The batteries last depends on the quality of the batteries. Normally will last for months. This thing is not real people, it just looks real. You can get some that they blink only after dark and I seen one that follows you when you walk by
This dock will work with Samsung ATIV Tab P8510 (WinRT) as it seems they have the same connectors and no keyboard is available for the tablet. This IS the keyboard listed on Samsung website for XE700T1C 700 Slate. This keyboard completely covers the screen. The two extra USB ports are also pretty useful but it does add a bit of weight. This is for the 500T only. The 700T keyboard is Samsung Electronics ATIV Smart PC Pro Keyboard Dock (AA-RD8NMKD/US) This should work if this is the same as (now sold out) www
This product will by way of magnetizing itself to the compensator. If your.177 cal has a steel barrel it will work fine... It goes on the end of any caliber barrel. And the laser is pretty precise in the front... This product will work on any rifle. Because unlike other bore sighters that insert into the barrel, the Wheeler uses a magnet and attaches to the end. This product works on any caliber. Just needs to be a magnetic barrel. This will work as long as the muzzle end of your barrel is magnetic. This is not a "inside the chamber" laser bore sighter.
This product will fit two credit cards and and a drivers license easily, but three credit cards with raised numbers id a really tight fit. This case is white with dark grey accents. This product fits 5 not sure about 5sdoes it fit 5s? Yes, it does fit the 5s. 3 or less is perfect 4 is a little hard an 5 is out of the question. The case causes no obstruction at all! All headphones should work with the case. The phone is completely encased and not exposed when the bottom is flipped open, can the phone fall out? technically yes if you vigorously shake it. This
This product is lead and acid inside so it is heavy. This product is identical to the UB2180 battery in essence. This battery can take a charge, usually a charger comes with the scooter or device powered by this battery. An alternative charger might be a trickle charger.  Attach it to the battery (red + first, then black - ), then plug charger to outlet. The other, old school way, make a box using old car license plates,just bend to the
This product will not plug into a 2 prong outlet as it uses the top ones for support. The cover plate is removed and the new unit comes with an extra long center screw to hold it in place when you unplug an appliance. This may be helpful when you have all six outlets plugged in and you don't want to inadvertently pull the whole thing out by pulling one of the cords out. This outlet is rated at 15 amps. There is conflicting informaton in the answers. This product plugs into both outlets and expands the capacity to 6. The screw at the center of the plate is not necessary, it's just
The 312 is the same as the 312A, it is just a different company. The battery holder key chain kit is a plastic dispenser containing 6 batteries, and you can draw from one.

This is my second order -- a good deal. they last as long as the battries I get from my hearing  aid supplier.  Don't
This product is made in Japan and has 2 years TOKINA Warranty Service. This product works great with the Nikon D800. Nice and sharp in the middle, a little bit of softness along the corners but thats normal with a wide-angle. Just be careful with this lens since the aperture lever is prone to being bent by an impact since it sticks out. This lens is made for a full frame (FX) camera and the D3100 is a crop frame camera. This will work on both dx and fx cameras. The issue is that your camera relies on a focus motor in the lens,
This product is large enough to hold a steak, breast of chicken or a small pizza. The interior measurements are 12 inches wide, 12 inches deep directly in the center. The height inside from the bottom rack to the inside top is 5 inches. The dimensions of this product are 17 1/2w x 12d x 9h. This product will automatically shut off when the timer is used as opposed to the "always On" setting. The inside is 12 3/4" deep x 12 1/5" wide x 7" high. The width of the product is 12 1 /2" however, front to back
The table comes with a lid and it's very solidly constructed. It stays up well in practically all positions. It is also very easy to remove and put back on if you like to have it off during playback. The belt must be moved to a larger diameter part of the motor pulley. A rather simple task, but more complicated than flipping a switch. Takes about 30 seconds. The cartridge is decent, it has a very good and easy to install upgrade line of carts that range from around $225 to around $900. Depending on certain modifications and additions
This product will hold about 18 single DVD discs per shelf and each side would hold seven shelves worth. This product holds at least 500 single DVD's. The shelves are adjustable so I'm sure it'll accommodate to ur needs. There are no dividers/slots between CD's (or DVD's, for which I'm using the unit). You could position the shelves to store both CD's and DVD
The husband installed it and he said 'not that hard.' The hose is approximately 60". The hose My arm span is 5' 8" and the hose is about that long. The showerhead bracket right and left as well as up and down. The spray type and speed separately. There is no adjustable speed, only spray type. The presets are very comfortable and approprate for each setting. You can't turn the water flow off at the hand held head to conserve water No, that feature is not part of this particular showerhead. But you can switch to a low flow mode.  Hope that helps.
The 70-200 IS has image stabilization. The tripod mounting ring us included. So is the tulip lens hood. This lens has an EF mount on it, so it should fit on all recent model Canon DSLRs. This doesn't have IS and what would be only time you would need IS. Portraits and what else?? and How are 2X extensions on here, good quantity Primarily for low light handheld shooting. If you don't do any flash photography, or plan to shoot frequently in mostly dimly lit areas, perhaps you will need the IS.  If you can afford it, get the IS version
This product is made in China and is great looking and great machine. The hair need to reach a certain length before you can epilate but you don't want to wait too long. The longer, the more you will feel it. This product does pull the hair from the root just like wax, it has 3 different head, one for huge area like legs, the othe one for little area like face corners and the third one act just like liner+blade. It's your choice to use which of them on which area. It will work on facial hair but it's large and bulky so it may be
This item is called OTC 3111PRO on the front of the scanner but the tag on the back side says 3111 pro. This item will not read OBD codes on a 1995 S10 with an OBD2 connector. This product will read live data but it does not make parameter changes. The product will power train codes for sure. For ABS, Airbag & Transmission you will have to go to their website & look up your vehicle on the application chart. Even then it might not work but that's for a whole another discussion This item doesn't give you Mode 6 Data; it only shows "
This phone has the standard 3.5mm audio jack. So it will definitely work without a case. It may not fit with certain cases though. They are pretty light weight. They'll be uncomfortable when wearing them for long periods of time at first, but you'll end up getting used to it. Made it tough to snap the wire. If it gets pulled out of your ear it will not loosen up the wiring from the headphone and brake or loss connection. Kevlar would make the cable stronger hence more durable. Cord noise is low. The micro phone is easy to use and it sits right below the chin. Very
This product will maintain for five months but you will need to use a cart charger first with battery fluid up to snuff, cause over a 6 month period, in hot weather, the batteries will loose some fluid.

This product will work for a 36 Volt Golf Cart system consisting of six 6-volt batteries.

You can use this while driving if you are careful not to put too much physical pressure on the unit. It only runs for 30 minutes so shouldn't be a problem. The remote comes with a battery (watch). The batteries for the unit lasted about five weeks of wearing five days per week. The unit uses two AA batteries and the remote uses a CR2032. The controller batteries are expensive $4 - $5 a piece. If you purchase this and have oily (or even semi-oily) skin, buy extra pads. The Hollywog takes 2 AAA batteries and

It can help with menstrual cycle cramps, soothe aching muscles
The description on Amazon says that its shipping weight is 3 pounds. That seems about right. It's not light, but the Roll and Go seat is about half as heavy as the original. This particular version does not come with a seat cover. However the seat cover can be purchased separately. The roll & go seat is only about 3/4" thick so it does not raise one's seating level in a car noticeably. The height change is not significant but the comfort is. Very comfortable. Able to sit up straight and relieved pressure on lower back.  They are a bit heavy and floppy to carry, find a

Lawn has to be flat no bumps. Most of what it picks up flys right back out the front. A small roller brush that picks up and anything but leaves gets hung up in the roller brush. A rolling set of bristles sweep dry fragments and whole leaves into the catcher and does this best when the ground is level, like a carpet sweeper.  Heavy, freshly-cut grass that has been left in clumps by the mower would frustrate you...will i pick up pine needles and cut grass That depends on how thick the needles or grass it. If you cut your grass weekly this will sweep
This product uses 3" tabs. This product will work on a 3000 gal swim spa but you may need to buy the spa insert so fewer tablets are used. The product description claims that this product holds 11 large trichlor tablets. But the answers say 5 or 6, which is it?  Thanks. The flow direction matter when installing the inline chlorinator. Of course. There is a flow directional line on the base of the chlorinator
This unit only works on existing cable services. It basically would replace the set top box that the cable company would rent you. You can purchase the lifetime service plan. Not the cheapest but worth it if you plan to use it for a while. The size of the hard drive depends on what you order.

Use heavy-duty lag bolts. 100 lbs is the limit you can check the specifications to be positive. This is designed to lift and not pull.
The ingredients match exactly the NOW enzymes product. The NOW brand is 1/4 the cost per capsule. The capsules are as big as any other capsule or multivitamin. Not at all, but it helps get more nutrients from the foods you eat, less bloating& digestive discomfort. Hope that helps! No, you don't need to refrigerate enzymes. Made in USA, but nit sure where! Magnesium Stearate is listed on the label. The label does not list a percentage for this ingredient. It's listed under "other ingredients." It says they contain Ox bile. Ox being an animal,

This product is available in dodge durango. This product will not fit a 2014 Jeep Cherokee sport model as the Cherokee is much smaller inside than the Grand Cherokee. This will fit a 2015 Jeep Cherokee WK. The net shipped from Mopar does fit the 2015 Grand Cherokee and does stretch. This is made for the grand cherokkes only.

The drawer has one big space. Measure utensil holders if you plan on using them since the standard ones dont fit in vertically. The wheels on the rear legs have a locking mechanism. The wood is already stained. It's a kind of light oak color. This piece should last for many years. It is unfinished. It has a thin coat of something on it for protection.  But you can finish it to your tastes. The top won't damage the wood or the knife.  It's not cutting board material.
This product comes with the footrests and they can be removed. This product slides on and off. The bucket slides out, but if the person's bottom is in the way, it will rub them or pinch them. The heighth of the shower chair is 21'' This product should not be used in the shower. The papers that come with it will tell you that as well. If you have a traditional toilet it will fit but if your toilet is raised it will not fit. The commode surface is 19 inches above floor. With the Padded cover on it is 20 1/2 inches above the
The mic for this Sony MDRNC8/WMI works only for noise cancelling and will not work on PC. The "active" noise canceling is very minimal. The headphone is smaller. The headphones work with any device has 3.5 mm headphone jack. This headset comes with an adapter for different kind of outlet not sure if its for airplane. These headphones block out traffic noise and loud music from neighbors parties. These are on the ear.
The 818 had it then it was removed from the 828. This unit sports the new Onkyo's proprietary AccuEQ calibration instead of Audyssey's MultEQ XT32. It has it own 'Onkyo" version.

Elements burned out after 7-months of 'light' use. Returned it to Breville who is sending another at no charge. 7 1/2" high, 10" long (plus 5/8" for sliding toast color knob), 6 3/4" wide. The exact dimensions of the toaster don't match up to the specs on the Breville site. To be sure you don't have interference with the controls, you need minimum of 12" deep. It will take 11 1/ 2-12 inches wide. Half bagels are no problem and the unit toasts perfectly. The heating elements
The receiver comes in the box. You can mount it on a stand, on a picnic table, the bed of your truck, on top of your car or the back of your dog if you can make him STAY long enough to watch a whole show. This dish will work with any Dish network receiver. Any satellite that it can see, it will pick up. You must buy the traveler for Direct TV. This will only work on the Dish Network so only TV no internet, you would have to get a different dish strictly for internet. You only need the power to lower and raise and you could do,that with

The one for the street glide should fit it! Hope this helps you
This housing has a button for the shortcut function on the back. Yes it does come with a guarantee Yes, the product is ok! thanks. No, it did not include a fibre optic cable or adaptor. There is a diffuser included, for use with the camera's external flash unit. It has a very short effective flash range of about 1 foot. You need to purchase a tray and strobe arms to attach the strobe light.  Really easy to do and not worth risking the camera by not doing it lubricate the o-ring before the first use, after that it should be good for sometime

This product is definitely made to hold an iPad 3. It is adjustable, so it may fit with a case, but it probably depends on the total dimensions with the case. The size of the screw that is on the iPad end of that angled adapter (not the pole end) is about a 1/4 inch. It attaches to the stand but the stand is not included. This product can be used without the adapter included and screw directly on a microphone stand. This will support the iPad 4. According to Wikipedia, the 4 and the 3 are the same dimensions - so if you trust Wikipedia the answer is "
This package brings the Quick Charger MH-24 charger. This is not a "Grey Market"  offering in addition to what you see in the images that brings the package. Usually the body comes separate, and the lenses separate.  So the bundle here saves a lot of hassle rounding up all the pieces of equipment you will probably want anyway.  Usually there is a good savings, if the lenses are branded. Covers come with the lenses. There was a hood on the zoom. This camera is not built with WiFi. This kit includes lens covers, battery charger, neck strap. All of the above...
The King Arthur Flour site says it would take 6 quarts for a 5lb bag of flour. This one has 7.5 quarts, so it should fit. The containers are #5 and Lids are #4 plastic ratings. These containers are marked as 2,4,6, etc and the litres are marked 2, 4,6 etc. The 6 quart comes in a pack of 2. The lids make a watertight seal. These are 6.75 inches tall. This product is made in the USA. The product is sort of cloudy - you can see what's inside, but it's
This battery will charge any smartphone with a usb cable. It has two outputs 1 DC 5V/1A and 1 DC5V/2A. While charging and iPad and iPhone simultaneously, the center felt warm, but never hot. Charging just one device at a time results in no temperature change at all. The product is a big power extra battery.  One side will output 2amps so it can be used to charge power hungry devices.  Sorry I have only used this for my phone so I don't know. The connection at the outlet gets very hot.
Fits perfectly even the cubbies on both sides. Perfectly! There is a small lip all the way around it. A1 The Mazda CX-5 does not have a third row seat option. However, the cargo tray does fully cover the cargo area with a lip to contain most spills. This fits like a glove. Exactly same as one you buy at dealers, but at half price.  The dealer could confirm this for you. Yes, raised lip throughout entire circumference of the tray. It is NOT just one flat surface.
These wipers will fit your Ford Expedition so long as you buy the same length wiper blade as on your car.

There are 12 holes. It conforms to the standard size of shower curtains (and packs of the curtain hangers!). This shower curtain blow in when the shower is on. Heavy material so it won't do that. Not offensive. Disappears in a few days. It is a much heavier weight than typical liners, so it doesn't billow out. This product does not include hooks. It has holes for hooks but no hooks. This gives off an odor. Highly toxic fumes - Do not buy.
This product cannot be taken apart easily. You could potentially attach it to a stand and move it around but it is much better suited attached to a wall. The mounting points are flush to the back. About 1 inch down from the boarder. They slide on the frame slot along the top edge. This frame is fantastic but better suited to mount and leave mounted. The frame is sturdy on all 4 sides. It is not extremely heavy but would be awkward to install and remove
This product does not hold up to recoil as a weapon light. This product uses lithium A123 batteries and they're lighter so maybe they'd hold up better that way. This light does not come with a holster but the clip is very secure. The flashlight gets very hot after 15 minutes turned on at maximum power. The 18650 is a little thicker. The batteries are a strange size and very expensive. Don't buy it. The Maglite XL200 does offer that feature as well as others. The switch be "locked out" so it won't turn on if its packed in something like a backpack. Great
