        "answer": "In my experience, that's exactly what happens. You insert the card, take the pictures, and download them to your computer. However, the software to download is supposed to be on your camera, and when you connect your camera to your computer, it is suppose to download the software. My last experience with a Kodak camera, the software on the camera did not work and there's no support at Kodak. If you have a printer that supports it, you can download your memory card to your computer that way.",

However I like to note that this has some issues if you are using it as an extension for tablets to TV's. Sometimes its doesn't work and its like the coupler needs to be plugged in a certain orientation. This is a cheap but useful coupler but I highly recommend getting a better quality one. :D Hope this helps you!",

        "answer": "If mounted to the wall or door, I think it would hold books well.  Kids books often seem either very small or huge.  You can check the item description for the depth of the shelf to determine if you could place them like a bookshelf or you'd need to display them with the cover/back against the wall/door.  BUT, yes - I think it would really hold general house-stuff nicely, but securing it to the wall or door is essential especially if children will be using it. Gotta keep the little ones safe :) Thanks!",

I use mine on the back of my pantry closet and its so heavy it started pulling the screws out of the hinges. I had to put in longer screws. Also  when it's loaded it swings back and forth when I open  the door. I need to find a way to fasten it to the door about mid  way. It might be okay if screwed into wall studs.",

      "If the low water pressure seems restricted to a single faucet or showerhead, the problem isn't with your pipes or water supply, but with the fixture itself. If it's a sink, the most common causes are a clogged aerator or clogged cartridge. If the trigger of the sink sprayer is stuck on, work a flat-head screwdriver under the handle of the spray nozzle and push down on the spray button to stop the nozzle from spraying. Brushed chrome has a blueish hue and is less shiny than polished chrome. Chrome itself is commonly plated onto another metal such as copper or nickel to provide a little extra hardness and resistance, as well as a shiny finish. Although you can't completely keep your faucet from spotting unless you install a water softener, by cleaning the faucet regularly you can prevent deposits from building up, so the chrome looks its best at all times."

You put the filter under the retainer and put ground coffee in the filter. You have to make sure the top ring secures the top of the filter so it does  not overflow. That  will make  great coffee.",

It has a different, bayonet mount for each camera brand, but all screw onto the same thread on the lens.  There is no electronic focus or f-stop setting system which is why this is inexpensive. It'll need a good tripod and a very well-lit place. Even though, fast moments will likely be fuzzy. The item's lens actually has a  T-mount with an EF adapter, so any Canon with an EF mount will fit. With an appropriate adapter it will work plus it's fully manual, so there's not that much to make work. You can lso use 2x adapter between the lens and body. There is a kit included on Amazon but you might find it difficult to stabilize the lens to get decent photos.

This product provides traffic updates and the option to choose a route or area to avoid is available."

This kit's description only mentions the top and side panels. It does not mention the bottom, or the geotextile that goes around sides. The first is backwash, the second is the brine soak, the third is rinse. In most water softeners all three steps discharge liquid through the same tube. The second step is the problem.  If you use sodium chloride to recharge the resin cartridge the concentrated salt water will be discharged into the ground. You could switch to potassium chloride which is more expensive but less harmful to ground water. The capacity of this product is 50 gallons."

The timer has a loud beep that repeats a lot. The tone is annoying but can be heard from other rooms. This product sticks to a fridge magnetically. The top slot is usually the clock and the bottom the count up feature. This product beeps when you press buttons as well. This product doesn't give a warning tone 5 or 10 minutes before the time is up."

The maximum height for a cup is around 7\".T he coffee maker does not have an automatic feature. Once you pour the water in, you press the button to brew until the cup is done. It then turns itself off. Try to use Melitta single serve coffee fillers for this particular product. They should work perfectly in this machine. If you wish for a stronger brew, use the bold one. You can adjust it by the amount of coffee you add into it as well."

The total depth of the cup part is approx. 2 3/4\".  If you are wanting to grind flax seeds or something small, this does a great job.  You need to be careful if you don't want to reduce them to powder.  Try using short bursts.  Good luck and write if you have any other questions.",

Pull it down from the car visor just about half-way, and then push the car visor all way forward towards the windshield (if the polarized visor was still folded up, it would actually be on top of the car visor). Then just adjust the polarized visor to your correct height by tilting it towards you or lowering the car visor a bit. There won't be any gap.",

I drop the car visor just enough to deploy the filter and then angle the filter to get it before my eyes but not so much as to create the gap you are talking about.  I believe if you experiment with this idea you will find it works.  But be aware this filter is not for direct sunlight relief.  Polarizing filters are for reflected light.  If you are going to drive during hours of low direct sunlight you will need a dark shade filter in addition to this products.  Mark",

But by tilting the car visor 80-85 degree angle and with the attached visor pulled down, the gap is not seen.  Thus your eyes are not blinded by the sun.  I especially love it on those times driving into the sunset.",

I just made sure that the Velcro straps went around the visor out side the little mirror.  So if you want to see yourself you fold down this polarized car thingy and open the mirror flap.  It is really a good extra visor and you get what you pay for.  It has clear vision etc. Well made.  Would buy it again.  Hope the long answer helps.",

I would take their advice and install it on the outside surface so the mirror is still available.  That being said, I am not a mirror user, so it is not an issue with me.  Plus the fact that I live in Michigan, not Florida, so I will probably take the visor off in winter when we don't have much sun.  Would I buy it again or recommend it?  Yes, I love it!  It functions very well and is a good design.  Is it a bit pricey?  Yes, but you get what you pay for.",

I have installed it on the outside surface of the visor so it is not covering the mirror. The straps are running either side of the mirror.  Also, I find it easier to flip down the polarizer without having to first lower the visor assembly.  Then I lower the visor assembly as needed for perfect positioning of the filter.

The rod is one piece and includes a case. The rod is strong enough to be used with steel lines. This rod is good for trolling type reels like the Tiagra Penn International.

You just need to see if they print black and white separately. Some printers will mix all colors to make black and white printouts, others have a dedicated black and white cartridge or drum. It is more ideal to have a separate unit for black and white as mixing the colors to make black and white eats the levels of ink or toner very quickly. I hope that makes sense.- Damon",

      "A 2000w generator would be able to run this charger, as long as there aren't other major loads on the generator. The item draws a maximum of 13 amps at 120 VAC. If it is an inverter generator then this isn't necessary. The item can be used for a battery bank (600ah) with 6 batteries. A battery has to have about 600 cold cranking amps to turn over a car motor. The product charges and when it doesn't need to charge it goes into float mode. There isn't an on- off switch. You can expect about 11 to 12 amps at full current operation. The item has a standard 3 prong for plugging it into a trailer. The difference between this and the PMBC-100 which is also a 100A battery charger, is that the PMBC-100 include 6 ft. cables with clamps. This item will run led flood lights from a generator without a battery."

My only issue has been an occasional SLIGHT hesitation of the hang-up buttons located underneath the handset.  In its defense, I have a \"new old stock\" 1957 model 500 (which this was designed after), and it does the same thing.  I would definitely purchase the Cortelco phone again.  I don't know how the red compares to the black model.",

To fill this dehumidifier you lift out the water reservoir and flip it over. It is light and has a handle. This dehumidifier is a warm only humidifier, not hot. The dehumidifier shuts off when there isn't any more water. This dehumidifier does not have a nightlight - it has a small red light when it's out of water and a green light when it is on. This dehumidifier does not have filters that need to be replaced. The dehumidifier is different from the previous version because it doesn't leak like the previous one could, the bottom is different and is reasonably quiet."

These filters will work with the Sony E-mount system (Sony Nex series) because it has the same 40.5mm filter diameter. Since the Samsung 20-50mm lens is also 40.5 mm, these filters will fit that product. These filters are unable to fit a Nikon AW100 , because it does not have filter adaptability and these filters require a 40.5mm thread size. These filters may produce dark corners on NEX 16mm (24mm equivalent) lenses. A thinner rim may be required. These filters are made of glass. Using standard shipping, these filters will ship from Cameta Camera within 2 business days of receiving the order from Amazon."

Airsoft ammo is a larger diameter than BBs which can fit 1 bullet per cylinder with BBs that fit in the tip of the simulated bullet. This is an excellent revolver which is original. This product comes with everything you will need except the bbs, the oil you'll need for them, and the co2."

If you just ignore it, it will beep about 20 times and then stop on its own, showing the time you set on the alarm.  I find this timer works very well; it survives being knocked down from the stove -- it is durable -- well worth the price.",

      "This pad will scratch gel-coated marble because it is abrasive. The Casabella Flex Neck is good for cleaning bathtubs and old-fashioned porcelain wall tile. Search for these in the Sponge Mop section. This pad works on the curves between the walls and the curved bottom of the tub but must be pressed hard to get it to bend when new. It will be much more flexible with regular use. Extra sponges are unavailable with this package but can be purchased on Amazon. The sponge attaches to the holder easily with Velcro-like backing. The holder attaches to the pole via a flexible rubber neck and it is durable. This scrubber is safe for the acrylic enclosed bath fitter, with no bending required. This product can also be used in a fully hones marble shower or on polished marble, as it is able to clean tile and grout well with no scratches. It is not recommended for use on fiberglass, as fiberglass should be cleaned with a non abrasive microfiber cloth."

The 1/2\" tape can handle 8, 10 and 12 point text size; the 3/8\" only handles 8 and 10 point text size. I hope I didn't confuse you. You can print the \"User Guide\" from the DYMO website.",

In order to print directly from a computer, just plug in the included cable  into your printer, plug the other end to your computer's USB port, and click \"Print\". The box comes with one roll of 1/2\"x10', black ink on white, laminated (glossy) and comes in 2 other sizes including1/4\" and 3/8\" which is sold separately and not included in the box. You can switch the cartridges in and out without finishing the entire roll first. It comes with a working charger. There is not excessive non-printed labeling left over when you cut. This unit can only be charged using the power adapter provided as the USB port is used for data only and does not support power functionality.

There is no viewfinder on this camera because the monitor is big enough so viewfinder not really needed. Surprising light gathering abilities of this camera make these shots easy and of very good quality, and moving shots necessarily show the motions. This product is compatible with 220v and can be used with any tripod that has the screw you can use under the camera. When the camera is in auto, it's only an auto/off mode, whereas in P mode, you can also set it to \"always on\" and \"slow synchro\". Slow synchro keeps subjects and distant background brights."

Like other telephoto lenses, the EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III compresses perspective and allows the photographer to restrict depth of field. It works with 70-200s and the 100-400, 135/2 and 180/3.5 macro, and is optimized for Canon's big white supertelephoto lenses. It wont work well or at all with f/5.6 zooms or normal 50mm, 85mm or 100mm lenses. The Canon 100-400mm lens is best used for wildlife and sports, although it's also very good for photographing portraits, landscapes, and airshows. It's designed for full frame Canon cameras, but functions perfectly with \"crop\" cameras too."

The case works with an auto-sleep when you close the case. The product comes without a handle or hand strap to use while reading. The kindle will fit but you will have to put it in upside down with the camera on the bottom and the volume and on/off buttons on the left.  Fold back the stand for the kindle into the standing position to allow the logo to be upright. The kindle should auto sleep with this case however you will need to turn it 180 degrees as this case is more suited for left handed people. The product can only stand horizontally. Look in the instructions that come included for step by step instructions to bring the keyboard up."

If you are new to the game and you want to play from start to finish it will take 16 to 20 hours. This game is actually way faster and you use the game pad to navigate so way easier than the GameCube versionCx however the game is single player. If you are a solo player get zelda.  If you like to play with friends get smash.  Although a very good game, zelda has low replay value compared to smash."

      "This product is an Olympic weight bench and should only be used with a 7 foot bar as a 5 foot bar would not allow for stackable weights and can be declined past flat by removing the bar under the bench which allows for 2 different incline positions as well as a flat position and it has a back that goes to a 90 degree position for shoulder presses. This item has enough space to use the bench for dumbbell chest flies with the bench flat. This product has a length and girth of 30\" x 16\" with a total of 47\" and can be used for a larger guy. This can also be used with standard 1\" hole weights on the leg lift as the bench will primarily hold the size. Bar and weights are not included upon purchase. Item was shipped in good condition."

      "This product works by housing the butter in the lid, shaped like an inverted bell, and water in the base. The cold water helps the butter stay fresh for up to 30 days when left on the counter. When you want to serve the butter, the top part rests securely on the table. Make sure you change the water every 3 days. This step ensures fresher butter for longer periods of time. Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers."

      "To change the batteries in this product, any device present on the right hand side must be removed to provide access to the right hand battery compartment. The left hand battery compartment remains accessible even with a keyboard and trackpad installed. This Bluefin is used to hold an Apple keyboard and a trackpad together. It is possible to use this product on a soft surface such as a bed if the product is properly supported. This item features two power buttons that are located on the right side of the product, as well as silicone tabs that cover the screw top in order to allow the adjoining power button for the keyboard and track pad to be engaged when the left side of the keyboard and the right side of the track pad are pressed against each other. This product features a thin silicone sticker that cover the battery door of one of the attached devices so that the power for the other device can be turned on by lightly squeezing both devices together while they are attached with the Bluefin. It may be necessary to use another item to keep the keyboard and trackpad separate during transport to prevent power from being turned on accidentally. This product is not compatible with the Logitech K811 keyboard. Information about this product's compatibility with iPads is unavailable. To determine whether this product would fit a keyboard that measures 11 x 5 1/16 inches and a trackpad that measures 5 1/4 x 5 1/16 inches, it would be necessary to compare those dimensions with the dimensions of the apple wireless keyboard and track pad for which this product was made. This product is designed to fit Apple brand wireless keyboards and trackpads and is not compatible with other brands such as Logitech."

      "Two adults can fit under this tent comfortably with room left for a child or small adult to lie on a blanket behind them. Depending on the position of the sun, the umbrella casts a large shadow and a third or fourth chair can be used to enjoy the shade. This pole is slightly smaller than a typical patio umbrella. It will tighten whatever screws hold it on the patio stand. This umbrella fits in a screw in the ground holder. To secure it into sand/ soil, purchase a plastic mallet to pound it in the ground. It can be used as a normal umbrella. This product needs to be used with a typical standard height fold up chair and it is restricted as to how far back you could place the chair due to the slope of the umbrella. This product is about 8 feet in size when opened. It will accommodate about 4 lawn chairs inside. The instructions say it can be used standing up but an anchor is not provided. When lying down it gets very hot under it and using it standing up provides some air flow. The sport umbrella website has replacement parts including the screw cap."

You could order a special adaptor from a third party and hope it doesn't fall off. For less money both DeWalt and Milwakee make sanders that easily accept shop vac hoses. There is much less dust when connected to the suction of a vac than used with just a tiny bag for collection.",

The product is easy to connect to a shop vac through the port where the bag was connected. The voltage for this product is 110 volt AC. The port is about an inch and adaptor kits can be found for different sizes. The support grip has the ability to rotate and the knob unscrews enough to remove the band. It has an extra knob near the front and rear handle to make it super easy to use during long sanding periods. It comes with a cloth bag that fits on a 1/8th turn to release a hard rubber fitting and never falls off. It has a button in the handle to lock trigger on and a pad under the sanding disk that helps with maneuverability and command of the sander. Note that the product would take a long time to remove paint from steel."

They're very handy, but if you're looking for something for example,  leftovers for 4 to 6 people these would not do.  Dishwasher safe, however, I don't put the lids  in the dishwasher.  Pricey, but worth it.  They also fit better in the refrigerator rather than the round bowls.",

      "This micro case will fit a micro-sized unit, or it will fit a full-size unit as long as both are the tax power supply.If both the motherboard and case are M-ATX they should work well together. This case has smaller fans of 92mm whereas for a Corsair liquid cooler you would need a case with a larger fan of 120mm. The power and HD lights are under the power and reset button and you can see them in the front view photo with the product. There is hardware included to help you mount the motherboard. You must remove the screws first and then take a knife to gently pry the edges of the case off of the back until they pop off. You should do this on both sides. The MSI 970 and ATX are too large to fit inside this case as the board is too large. Smaller boards like a mini or ITX are better suited with this case, as they will only fit certain motherboards. The case fit may be very tight, but it is possible to buy products like a modular power supply or to mount uniquely to free up some space."

This product requires a cable to secure and has a slide-out design. The cable length is 40 inches in total. It also won't fit under the majority of car seats  it is moderately difficult to cut the cable. Scissors and wire cutters might be capable but it would be difficult but Bolt cutters would make it easy on the other hand. The time it would take to steal this box from a vehicle would vary according to their preparedness. The PP1k is a larger, thicker, more secure version of this product. Each time you open the box you must remove the cable. Once unlock it can be easily removed and comes with a separate lock plug without a cable and a key made of brass."

        "answer": "It does not have temp control. I think it would slow the thawing process down, but would not keep food frozen for very long, just as if you were to put frozen food in the refrigerator. Also, it seems to depend where you place the food in the cooler and how long you've been running the cooler--the longer you run it, the colder it seems to get nearest the output area.",

      "If you're looking to light a very large room, upwards-facing lights will be more effective for diffusing light further, whereas downwards-facing lights would be sufficient if you're only lighting a small space. This product would, however, also be subject to the primary use of the room. The correct height of the table lamp is typically determined by the seating piece and the height of the table beside it. The table lamp should be tall enough for the bottom of the lampshade to come to the eye level of the person seated beside it. Full-size fluorescent lamps are available in several shapes, including straight, U-shaped, and circular configurations. Lamp diameters range from 1\" to 2.5\". The most common lamp type is the four-foot (F40), 1.5\" diameter (also called T12) straight fluorescent lamp. The temperature of this metal is measured in degrees Kelvin. CRI is a measurement of a light source's accuracy in rendering different colors when compared to a reference light source with the same correlated color temperature. There are three primary types of voltage transformers (VT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic voltage transformer is a wire-wound transformer. To determine power in Watts, simply multiply Volts times the current in Amps. The 60 Hz doesn't matter. For a 120 volt outlet with nothing plugged in or whatever plugged in being off, the amps and therefore watts of the circuit is zero."

The product is 10 inches deep, with a partially recessed, flexible hose that is about one to two inches long. This product uses a fitted, short clear hose for continuous draining. An adapter can slip into the hose, allowing a garden hose to be threaded through the product. The product's vent is on top of the unit, allowing the warm air to release straight up without adjustment. This product is 240 watts, although the start up vs running requirements for electricity can be searched to confirm this. The product's capacity is about 5 quarts which is half of what the unit pulls in from air in one day. This product's cord is released from the back and requires two to three inches of clearance (to prevent the cord from bending). Additionally, the product gets warm which can cause damage to some wall coatings. While it is possible to place this unit close to the wall, it's not recommended. This product has multiple settings for humidity, some low enough that the fan could potentially never reach shutoff."

We have a lot of pine cones so we bought two and go double handed.  One hand is likely to have the weasel pointed the same way as the pine cone.  Good luck.",

It works well, but fills up fast, at least with the butternuts I've been using it for. The standard version is smaller..and that would be way too small for anything, I think.

        "answer": "I had it over my garage door and the 1st night it rained, water got into the battery compartment and motion sensor. I put it in a bowl of rice for a few days and it got most out to the point to where it would work again. I put a sealant around anywhere that i thought water could get in and it's been great ever since.  It just doesnt look the greatest lol. So to answer your question, it isnt weather proof unless you make it that way. Hope i helped.",

Not sure what caused this but I put new batteries in it and it didn't come on, so I cleaned on it a little more and it still wouldn't work...so I tossed it. I don't think I'll buy another one. BTW she lives in Southwest VA. near TN./VA. line, so I don't think wet weather is an issue in this instance. They may have improved them now as this was over a year ago.RKG",

        "answer": "Well, I have three.   One is inside a 7x7x7 refrigerated cooler as an emergency light should there be a power failure or some clown turns off the power -- works fine.   The other two are outside but under an overhang.   They do not get direct hits from rain but they do get the \"weather\" -- works fine.   They seem well built enough to take direct hits from water, essentially they're a glorified flash light with very little that can go wrong.   Plus you don't need to take out a second mortgage to buy one.....   I's say, give it a try..........",

Any movement or heat will trigger the \"light\" to light but once the movement is gone, it will take about 20 seconds to turn off. Think of a \"wide\" triangle within a 1/2 circle, 360 degrees is a full circle, 180 is 1/2, so 100 degrees is a portion of that circle. That one is supposed to have 72 lumens and this one has 42.

They're built to slide up and down, and are not round where the a regular chuck would clamp them. If you need to drill into concrete, though, an SDS type drill and bits is the best way to go. It's night and day in the difference between using a regular drill with a hammer function and a rotary hammer drill and bit. Rotary hammer drills and bits cut like butter...at least my Bosch does. The bits last far longer and it cuts my labor time tremendously.",

There is ample storage with top drawers for small items and wider bottom drawers for large items.The drawers are on a high quality sliding mechanism which allows the full extension of the drawers and easy access to items in the rear. The dresser includes a solid panel and a frosted glass panel for the doors. The panels could be reversed for alternate looks. If a somewhat transparent look is desired, the frosted glass can be used without the solid panel. The panels could be easily replaced with another material. A mirror is not included with the dresser. The finish is a flat white. The top drawers are lined in velvet while the other drawers are cedar lined. The only assembly needed is screwing the legs on. The dresser is well protected with ample packaging material."

The knife has a manual opening, but when opening it, it wants to open all the way. The main spring that holds the blade open applies pressure on the blade through the opening, but it doesn't assist the opening.

      "The stem of this umbrella is not made for placing in surfaces such as beach sand but it works well for level ground. The pole and ribs of the umbrella are made from metal and are painted white. The screws are plastic. As a rain umbrella it will only work for a light rain. It is less effective in a heavy rain. The umbrella does not include a clamp for attaching to a bleacher. The height of the umbrella can be adjusted from 3' to 8'. It opens to 60'' wide and has room for 2 adults. The umbrella is 8 pounds. The umbrella is easily collapsible with a push of a button. Despite its compactness and easy storage, it provides ample shade for 1-2 people. The umbrella is not tall enough to be used with a patio table and chairs. To secure the umbrella in windy conditions, metal rods are provided to pin it to the ground. A cooler or bags can be placed near the base but wind over 15mph may pose problems."
