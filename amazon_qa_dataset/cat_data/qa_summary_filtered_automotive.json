      "This product includes all the clamps with hangers welded to them and you can reuse your rubber isolators. It runs quietly and is better than the flowmaster super 10 series. It comes in stainless steel and aluminized metal. The stock pipe is louder than this product. This is a 4\" kit. A shorter pipe is also included for long bed truck configurations. The pipe may be illegal in California because they don't come with a Carb sticker which means they are deleting the CAT converter. The final pipe has the same size output as the rest of the exhaust and includes the muffler and a free flow resonator with a great tone."

You can also remove the spark plug, insert a flexible rope  (cloth drying rope) in the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of the stroke, rotate the crankshaft to squeeze together near top dead center to hold the valve up while the valve spring is taken off and put back on.

      "The Cylinder Leakage tester Kit is only used to measure leakage in each cylinder, an OTC compression gauge would be useful as another testing tool. As for a Nissan/Infiniti, it would need a totally different tool than the cylinder leakage tool. This measures air leakage in cylinders and heads.  The product is only for gas engines it wouldn't work with 2006 Cummins diesel 5.9Ltr. It can be used on a 2 stroke. Make sure piston rings are above the exhaust and the crank is locked whenever it up the pressure. It doesn't need the whole gauge to pressurize a cylinder to change valve springs on an engine. Use the end of a cylinder compression tester that screws into the spark plug hole.  As long as the sparkplug adapter fits it will work on a small block Ford and a '93 740i BMW. There is an adapter and what you see in the picture is what's included."

There is a way to lock this with a master lock so it can't be stolen very easily, there is a latch on it for a lock so that your spare is secure. Takes 30 mins to install and there is a spot on the mount and the handle that allows you to install a lock so the handle can't be turned to remove the spare. The handle to tighten on this tire carrier will poke out around 2 inches further than being flush with the rim tire. The cover will pop out a bit. The tire carrier mount does work with the stock third brake light. The carrier works with stock.  The tire carrier fits a 2007 to 2014 jks there is another kit for the 1994 Wrangler YJ.",

Additionally, more than 24 hours may be needed to restore performance on some batteries. This product will adjust the amp's input automatically, the input current oscillates on and off at a very fast rate, which loosens the lead sulfate from the plates.

This product requires a cable to secure and has a slide-out design. The cable length is 40 inches in total. It also won't fit under the majority of car seats  it is moderately difficult to cut the cable. Scissors and wire cutters might be capable but it would be difficult but Bolt cutters would make it easy on the other hand. The time it would take to steal this box from a vehicle would vary according to their preparedness. The PP1k is a larger, thicker, more secure version of this product.

Depending on year of your vehicle I would suggest spending a little extra money and getting the new head light pig tails. The H4 lamps have a higher temperature than the original 7 inch head lights.

This is very portable and a single 4.0 battery could do 10+ tubes.  These batteries will fit any 20-volt tool and item will not work with a 12 volt charger. This kit comes with a charger and an excellent price.",

      "These wipers will fit a 2012 Ford Expedition if you buy the same length blade as the ones on your car. Measure both sides of the car as some vehicles have different lengths for each side. The product can also fit a 2008 Toyota Tacoma. One is 22\" and one is 21\". Information can be found on their website and also can fit a Chrysler 300 - 2006 check their website for the information. Can also fit on a Civic depending on the model. Check the Amazon Page and pick out your specific car details to get a more accurate answer. According to a website, you'll need a 22\" for the driver's side and passengers' side with a 16\" for the rear. The default is for hooks but it comes with an adapter. It really depends on the type of connection. The connectors are made of plastic but they resist well to freezing cold temperatures. This product won't work on a 2006 Mercedes C280. Check out the Bosch 3 397 118 933 AeroTwin Wiper Blades instead."

I can say they will definitely rejuvinate   And add considerable life to all the batteries I have used it on. It takes time and follow directions and allow the lights on the unit sequence through their cycle (sometimes 2 days for super low battery). Once the battery is normal again, use this unit monthly to keep the battery going as long as possible.",

H4 Adapters means that the projector has an adapter plate that allows for easier installation. The projectors take a D2S bulb rather than an OEM H4 bulb. This projector can use a D2C without any issues. This product can be installed as easily as a mini h1 projector if you buy adapters that are compatible with your car. Head light glass will need to be removed though. This product uses mini D2S HID bulbs and it has both high and low beams. There is also a flap that moves down which activates the high beams.

In this example, IF your C-papa machine operates at 100 watts, the EL2601 inverter would be more than ample. The battery that you would want to have already, fully charged, would be a large deep cycle battery.

So, if I read the spec of your fridge correctly => 0.8 A (which seems low to me but I am not really sure what is typical), it should work.",

        "answer": "Sally, there's a very simple answer. When the Polarized visor is mounted as instructed, it's on the bottom of the car visor. Pull it down from the car visor just about half-way, and then push the car visor all way forward towards the windshield (if the polarized visor was still folded up, it would actually be on top of the car visor). Then just adjust the polarized visor to your correct height by tilting it towards you or lowering the car visor a bit. There won't be any gap.",

        "answer": "Sally,  The way I do this is by changing the angular relationship between the car visor and the polarizing filter. I drop the car visor just enough to deploy the filter and then angle the filter to get it before my eyes but not so much as to create the gap you are talking about.  I believe if you experiment with this idea you will find it works.  But be aware this filter is not for direct sunlight relief.  Polarizing filters are for reflected light.  If you are going to drive during hours of low direct sunlight you will need a dark shade filter in addition to this products.  Mark",

        "answer": "Hi Sally,  If the car visor is at a 90 degree angle from the roof of the car, the gap shows and sunlight comes through.  But by tilting the car visor 80-85 degree angle and with the attached visor pulled down, the gap is not seen.  Thus your eyes are not blinded by the sun.  I especially love it on those times driving into the sunset.",

        "answer": "When folded up it is against the mirror.  What they don't show is that it also has Velcro straps. I just made sure that the Velcro straps went around the visor out side the little mirror.  So if you want to see yourself you fold down this polarized car thingy and open the mirror flap.  It is really a good extra visor and you get what you pay for.  It has clear vision etc. Well made.  Would buy it again.  Hope the long answer helps.",

        "answer": "Looking at how other folks answered this question, I installed it differently as I am not one to even use the mirror. I would take their advice and install it on the outside surface so the mirror is still available.  That being said, I am not a mirror user, so it is not an issue with me.  Plus the fact that I live in Michigan, not Florida, so I will probably take the visor off in winter when we don't have much sun.  Would I buy it again or recommend it?  Yes, I love it!  It functions very well and is a good design.  Is it a bit pricey?  Yes, but you get what you pay for.",

        "answer": "Hi Becky!  It is installed by metal clips backup by straps with velcro for a very secure mount.  I have installed it on the outside surface of the visor so it is not covering the mirror. The straps are running either side of the mirror.  Also, I find it easier to flip down the polarizer without having to first lower the visor assembly.  Then I lower the visor assembly as needed for perfect positioning of the filter.  Your last question was cut off so you will have to reask if you still need answer.  Mark",

      "This product is for use with 6 and 12 volt batteries. Both cables and the plug  are approximately 6 feet long and this charger has a timer. It depends on what you are jump starting. This item uses 110V  feeding adjustable voltage and plugs into a 120 v.a.c. outlet as long as you are jump starting it with a battery in your car and near a power outlet to plug this in. If it is a diesel with glow plugs, be aware that when you are using the high current tap, the charger is putting out about 17 volts and canburn up glow plugs if you turn them on while at this voltage."

      "This product can be used for gray or black water waste tanks with 3\" hose connection. It includes a tow bracket that will fit the opening of a garden hose using a standard 2/4 prong RV sewer hose. It is advised that you ensure it isn't filled too much as it will get heavy.  To empty the tank, connect a hose to the bottom with a 90 at the other end. The 90 will empty once you twist off the air vent as pictured. Since the hose isn't translucent, you would need to remove the hose to see if the tank is empty inside. This product can be toed behind a truck using a connection for your hitch that comes with purchase. The connection for the ball hitch to the tow tank is made of steel that fits to the hitch. This product can also be mounted to your bumper using a ball hitch as the handle has a hole that fits over the ball.",

If you don't have them, you can also tap into the auxiliary power port very easily with a small ring terminal end. You will have a good bit of extra wire to coil up. The lines between grips is long. Also, I recommend a different heat shrink for the thumb warmer, mine heated and wore through after only a few hours use.",

The difference between these two products is that the 4 zone allows you to plug in additional accessories with the same controller. The installation of this product is very easy. The grips should be turned off when the key is off to avoid draining the battery when it's stored. When the grips wear out, you would replace the grip only and buy the heating element. The only thing that would need to be replaced is the grips themselves. This product is universal and you can use WD40 to install the grips without a problem.

These strip lights bend like a watch band and can be sized by cutting along the scissor symbol. These strip lights are made to be placed on the outside of the light lens.  If the lens is clean, then the adhesive will do a great job. These strip lights turn on as soon as the engine starts via two methods. Either attach it to the day running light power line or buying a separate automatic switch."

You should disconnect both batteries first, once you have it off the vehicle you will find a small cover on top of the unit remove the cover, once you have the cover off you will find nuts underneath they must be removed in order to separate the top and bottom of the shell after removing the perimeter screws. The two halves can be difficult sometimes even with all the screws removed. Once you have the two halves apart you will need to free the control board from the unit.",

There is a full pocket behind it though that holds stuff.   This is a great bag.  I have even checked it on planes for trips when we rented bikes. Use some compression bags or compressed zip locks and you could live out of this thing for over a week.",

I would caution that the GranTour Bag is large and that for a small scooter could possibly,if not careful,could be overloaded in a manner which could alter handling characteristics. It is a wonderful bag mounted on my GL1500 Goldwing. Remember consider weight and measure measure measure! Hope this helps.",

      "This bag will give some support because it is semi-ridged. But if it is mounted without a sissybar or in front of the sissybar, it will need some contents in it to give support. This bag has dimensions of 21.1\" x 17.7\" x 13.3\" and the interior compartment is a little bit smaller but provides room to contain one XL modular helmet inside the bag only. This will work on a Honda Metropolitan Scooter if it has a luggage rack only and a Honda Rebel 250 2002 when secured properly to the passenger seat, fender or backrest.  This can be carried by a handle on the back of the small pocket and leans forward when fulland can also be used as a pet carrier because the bag closes completely which isn't like the Pet Palace bag."

I cannot say for sure that the Excalade is identical.  It has a plastic screw in center and push connectors on the sides of the cover.  With cover removed, the plugin just plugs to the top row of connectors second from the left.  Then just tuck the wiring out of the way under the dash (plastic electrical ties) and mount the brake controller on the bottom of the dash with provided bracket.  Done.",

It comes slightly pre-greased but needs to be topped off once installed with the zerk fittings in order to properly fill the boot with grease. This includes only one sway bar link rather than a pair and is the same for the left and right sides. There are numerous bushings listed with different part numbers. Sway bar bushings go with this product and would be installed separately. New bushings aren't required with new links. The links go on the end of the sway bar, while the bushings hold the bar to the body. Check new bushings whether they are the front or rear bushings."

        "answer": "With the SOHC engine, Aisin states that the correct kit would be TFK006 and they footnote that this is for the vehicle with a manual transmission, however, other aftermarket sources do not breakout a difference in the transmission.  Contitech shows the same coverage is part number PP304LK6.  I believe that the one variable on these engines is the water pump configuration so you might want to try and verify the image of the water pump and the number of outlets visible.Bruce",

The timing belt that is behind the plastic covers, is not visible. The item Aisin kit TKF-006 is the correct item.  The main difference between this product and the other Aisin product  is that this kit includes a tensioner. The front crank seal, the cam seals, and the accessory drive belt might be a good idea to replace as part of timing belt job, due to significant labor involved to access this area.  It will fit for 2008 Acura MDX, 2007 Honda Pilot, and for a v6 perfectly as it is identical to OEM parts. However, you can also try to enter your make, model, year on Amazon and you will get the best answer on which kit fits. It's will not suit the Honda Accord 2008 LX 2.4. If this kit is the same motor size as the 2005 Acura TL, then this kit will be correct. Check with the distributor to know the correct kit for application."

One cup of flour and one cup of water for example are different weight-wise but the same volume-wise. They have different densities. You'll want to buy and use a scale for this reason. Go to their website and follow the recipe for the correct density to be used. Chemically these are all the same but sodium hydroxide dissolves very quickly.

The way it works is you loosen a bolt that clamp the foot to the cross bar.  That allows the distance between the feet to change.  It's really easy to use and take on and off. I've had other systems before and this is by far the best quality and easiest to use of the group.",
