The spice tea comes in decaf and is one of their pungent teas so it can make 2 cups of tea with one tea bag. This tea is free of added sugars putting it in the range of average black tea with around two to three calories per 8 oz serving. There is a very intense but sweet taste to this tea."

We bottle only our own honey, from our own hives. We do NOT blend, mix, micro-filter, or heat pasteurize our honey. All that being said, no beekeeper knows each and every plant that his or her bees visits, it's a physical impossibility in the modern world for truly organic honey, and I would have more questions for a company that spends their efforts and money getting a certification, over taking care of their bees!",
