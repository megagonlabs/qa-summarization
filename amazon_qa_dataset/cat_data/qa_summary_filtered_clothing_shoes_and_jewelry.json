The shorts are made of a parachute like fabric and the fabric is lightweight, meaning it would not conceal a heavy object.  They have a zip fly and no button, but there are elastic insets on the sides which help the shorts to fit well without looking at all like an elastic waistband."

Please note that when closed correctly unless purged air will also be trapped in the bag, causing it to float unless something else drags it under.  Even when purged, some air will be trapped in the bag.  I did a 30 second test, but if you plan on using this as a dive bag or something of similar nature you should do your own tests.  That said it is made similarly to dive bags and so should function similarly.",

The laces are elastic which allows you to slip shoes on and off with ease and keep the laces from coming undone while exercising. They are actually pretty tight that you can really make up snug. This can be used for basketball on-court shoes and boots as this can be used for more than one lace. Best choice for safety and appropriation. This can be used for water shoes especially chlorinated pool water. This takes two hands to set up the lock laces into place, by slipping the laces into the locking wheel. After the setup process, fit the shoe how you want it to feel while wearing them and you will never need to tighten, loosen or use two hands to slip your shoes on again. This seems to hold up long.  The narrow diameter lets you pull the shoot/boots open to easily get a foot inside and then pull that slack out. Try using a scissor to unfasten the end cap with proper cutting method.",

After the set up process, fit the shoe how you want it to feel while wearing them and you will never need to tighten, loosen or use two hands to slip your shoes on again. The laces are elastic and allow you to slip shoe on and off with ease and keep the laces from coming undone while exercising. This can be used for more than one lace per shoe so this will work for boots and lets you pull the shoots open to rather easily get foot inside and then to pull that slack out."

        "answer": "I'm  a little unclear about your meaning of \"hardware\" I will say there's small brass like handles with a very nice leafy design. Inside drawer top drawer is a lay out for earrings. The next two drawers have bracelet slots. The last couple are un sectioned just deep enough to put what you want in them. I put my jewelry sets that come in their own boxes in the last few.  I wouldn't put anything as in  \"amo hardware\" in this item.",
