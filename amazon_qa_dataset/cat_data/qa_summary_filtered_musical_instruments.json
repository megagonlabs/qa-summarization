Most acoustic guitars will work if it's the kind of acoustic guitar with an instrument jack, if it uses a quarter-inch jack it will work. There is only one input jack. You can amplify anything as long as you have the right cord, and you can hook it either on your belt or waistband and go anywhere with it! Please be careful not to blow the speaker which may cause a crackling sound. You can play the guitar in the house and not be overwhelmed by the sound you would get from a bigger amp."

      "The Squier Bullet Mustang is the perfect guitar for any child or beginner. The slightly shorter scale length makes it easier for small hands to play and the two humbuckers are ideal for rockier and louder styles. For the nut width for your strings you want a nut width that is 1 3/4\" wide so it will be easier to fret notes without touching the wrong strings. This guitar is a wise choice for beginners or seasoned players with its solid construction and sweet tones. The strings produce a gentle or mellow sound which is found in Jazz and Latin music. Opposed to steel strings which are hard on the fingers, nylon strings are soft and gentle on the fingers which makes them a preferred choice for beginners."

Waterproof means that they are impervious to water.

Two of the most common remote control battery types include rechargeable lithium ion and alkaline batteries. These remote control batteries are easy to charge and minimize the need for purchasing replacement batteries. One remote can control multiple receivers.

      "Virtually all PCs and monitors use the standard 'kettle' lead connector for power. Typically you'll need two power cables, one for the PC and one for the monitor. Some monitors, however, have an external power supply, so you won't plug the kettle lead directly into the monitor. The mic stand is compatible with all microphones. Put something that can absorb sound underneath the keyboard, like a thin foam mat. Sound travels along multiple paths, including some that reflect up to a microphone from a hard desk surface. The Shure SM57 is one of the most widely used mics for guitar amps, but some other favorites include Sennheiser's e609 Silver, e906, and MD 421 II; Audix's i5; Royer's R-121; Telefunken's M81; and the Neumann U 47 fet. Choosing the best universal microphone shock mount is interesting because most microphone brands offer their own compatible shock mounts that are designed to perfectly fit the microphone they are designed for. In some cases, they don't offer a compatible shock mount, which is a great reason to get a universal one. Phantom power, commonly designated as +48V or P48, was designed to power microphones without using bulky external power supplies such as the ones required for tube microphones. It's most widely used as a power source for condenser microphones, which have active electronics. Be sure to verify whether your microphone is a condenser type or another type such as dynamic or ribbon. If it is a condenser microphone it will need phantom power, if it is a different type of microphone it will not."

      "This product has a steel reinforcing bar in the neck. There is nothing under the fake truss rod cover that says, \"steel reinforced neck\". Essentially all guitar necks are reinforced with something: an ebony, steel or carbon fiber bar, or one of various styles of adjustable truss rod.  Some left-handers play right-handed. Some left-handers play a right-handed guitar, but hold it with the neck to the right, so the bass string is nearest the floor. They learn the chord shapes up-side-down. You can go the route of restringing a regular right-handed guitar, this way you can use the guitar left-handed and the strings will be the right way around to play. Although flipping strings might seem like an easier option than buying a dedicated lefty guitar, you can start to notice issues. Tuning machines almost always use a bolt on nut from the front of the headstock and either a single mount screw or mount pins."

At the time, LP's were quite a bit more so many people started buying Jr's because of the cost difference. This locking case helps in taking good care of your guitar and offers several protective measures for it. Gibson standards come with Gibson cases. Gibson Tributes have a light satin finish.

        "answer": "There are numerous reasons including but not limited to the following: mismatch disc format between the master disc and the target media. e.g. copy dual layer master by single layer media; bad quality media- some cheaper brand media provide capacity that smaller than advertised; wrong media-using media that already has data on it.

      "A single sided, single layer DVD disc can hold 4.7gb of data and 2 hours (120 Minutes) of video in (SP) standard record mode. DVD 4.7gb discs recorded in (LP) long play mode can record up to 3 hours (180 minutes) of video and recorded in (EP) extended mode play, you can record up to 4 hours (240 minutes). Copying a DVD movie, also known as ripping, is done by turning the DVD's contents into a computer file and then burning that data onto a blank DVD disc. To do this, you will need the original DVD, a new disc, and a computer capable of playing DVDs, either through an internal player or external disc drive. To do this, you will need a disc copying program. The most popular and powerful disc copying program is CloneCD. CloneCD is available for free for 21 days, which should allow you to copy any CD you need to without having to pay. Instead of relying on a cloud-based service or an external hard drive, you can also use a variety of cables to transfer data. This method is typically speedier than using drives because files are being copied and pasted in tandem, PC to PC. Your computer's brain is the CPU: that's where all of the programming and computing happens. But its nervous system is the motherboard, which uses circuits to connect the CPU to the other pieces of hardware, including the memory, the hard drive, the CD/DVD drive, and all of your peripherals. If your computer uses a manual setting and you are located in North America, your volts should be set to 110-115. If you are located in Europe or other countries, more than likely, depending on the country, it should be set to 220-230. Copying files onto a CD-R  requires software that usually comes bundled with the drive."
