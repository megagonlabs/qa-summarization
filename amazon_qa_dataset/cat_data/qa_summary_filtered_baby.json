The product does not reheat the bottle automatically.  You need to manually heat the bottle up again if the bottle cools down. The bottle will not get too hot because the warmer stops when it finishes so it stops heating. The temperature gauge chooses between room temperature or fridge temperature and the number of ounces."

It's down to your (and your baby's) preference. Breastfeeding from only one side is usually not a concern, especially if you have an established milk supply. A closed system pump has a barrier between the milk you pump and the pump itself. The barrier means that no milk or fluids can get into the pump helping to prevent contamination. An open pump system has no barrier. If milk gets into the tubing, then the tubing must be cleaned and dried before using it again."

The product is intended to be pushed into a table, but a tray would still be reliable. Product is similar to other types of chairs seen in restaurants and this would give them the ability to be stackable and can slide underneath a table."
