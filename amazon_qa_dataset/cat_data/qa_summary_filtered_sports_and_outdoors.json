Yeah, you can fit 6 people in but they won't be moving around at all and will be packed edge to edge.  Realistically 4 is probably the most you'd want in any \"6 person\" tent.

Don't fold over the tent fabric because it could weaken so just stuff into stuff sack that is dry to allow very little air flow to prevent mildew. It comes with 8 stakes and 4 strings for the corners. This product will work well in strong wind and rain. This product can't handle a heavy light but a flashlight will be fine.

        "answer": "The Oxford WaterRower is extremely easy to store. Because of the way the unit is balanced, you can lift it up with one hand and easily roll it away for storage or just stand it so it takes up less floor space. You can stand it up with a tank full of water because of the way the tank is designed. It is an oval and you do no fill it entirely up (there is a calibrated level mark on the side of the tank). When it stands up, there is never any leakage because the fill port stays above the liquid level. The WaterRower is the best piece of home exercise equipment I have ever used.",

It is quiet for my second floor apartment for my neighbor, it is great looking wood and it takes up the space of my water cooler that has a five gallon bucket in it, with perhaps a few inches wider.  This is real and I expect every penny to be worth it.  I have owned it for about a month.  It arrived in two boxes and all was fine to assemble it.  Totally recommend it to friends and to strangers.

      "This product comes with a one year warranty initially and if you register the rower through Water Rower within the first year, the warranty gets upgraded to 3 to 5 years. This tank has graduated marks on a clear label indicating water level.  The higher the water level, the more resistance the rower has. Rowers are primarily used to work on core and back muscles. This item comes in many different woods including ash, cherry and walnut. The quality of the rower is consistent no matter what type of wood is chosen. The rower can be stored upright and therefore takes up very little space when not being used. The pad used to protect the bottom of the rower is a standard 36\" x 90\" mat The rower can be shipped to Shanghai. Check the manufacturer website for more information on all the locations this product can be shipped."

The flipper is just a piece of metal that is part of the blade itself that is a more convenient way to open the knife with one hand.

The difference between this knife and a conventional assisted opening knife is that this knife has a flipper you pull down on while flicking your wrist. The blade opens fully and locks quickly. This knife is very easy to sharpen. It takes a fine edge and is very sharp. The 154, s30v and Elmax are superior knives. However, this knife is a good value for the price. This knife includes the Kershaw warranty. This knife is very sturdy and will not break easily. This knife comes in a soft plastic sleeve, which is inside a blue and white kershaw box. The bottom cutting edge of this knife is sharpened on both sides. It is very sharp right out of the box."

As for your question, it would hold up great as far as the blade is concerned, however the handle is pretty wimpy so if any part of the sword would break it would be that or where the blade connects to the handle. The blade itself is insane, check out youtube: WeAllJuggleKnives does a great demo vid for cutting.",

You're only talking about a 16th of an inch taller, and the rear sights are adjustable to boot.

      "Dovetails are created to fit Glock 35s. If you will be fitting this alone, keep a dremel with a grinder bit nearby. It will take a steady hand to fit the dovetail properly. The sight will not fit a Glock 42. There are different sight sets for G26 and 27; those sights fit properly and are better for concealed carry. However, this sight may fit the G26 and G27. The sight can be used on a Gen 2 Glock 19 because Glock uses the same attachment method for the front and rear on all of their guns. A larger holster will be necessary because the front sight is larger. However the front sight is adjustable, and great for home defense. The sight is considered a highly visible and adjustable meprolite green variety. The sight will work well on a Gen 4 Glock G35 and 21."

        "answer": "It actually sharpens very well, and quickly! 8Cr13MoV is a high-grade stainless steel that is slightly softer than, say, AUS-8 (itss most comparative steel, some say). With a good diamond sharpener, I've found that the blade sharpens fast, and stays sharp under normal/moderately extreme use, from breaking down cardboard boxes to carving sandstone (though highly possible, the latter use is not a good use for any knife). Try the Smith's PocketPal sharpener or one of Kershaw's sharpeners. Hope that helps!",

There is an attachment point for a dangler, and one is NOT supplied.  I purchased one from JRE industries and am happy with it as an add-on. You may find other reviews on the sheath helpful - many seem to find it lacking in a knife of this price range.  I do not find fault with the sheath but wish it came with a snap on dangler.",

We've chosen to use water for the base instead of sand since the base is the box that holds all the Swingball parts when finished playing. I don't know how 'northern' your state is but I would say that unless the temp/wind chill is very cold, they should be able to enjoy it outdoors most any time of the year.",

After this time the reaction stops and can not be recharged. If oxygen is cut off, such as putting them into a ziplock bag, the reaction stops and they cool. Exposed to air again they resume generating heat, but never beyond a total of 10 hours they would have lasted if they were used continuously.",

The knife comes in the original wrapping which is bubble wrap and a Cold Steel Box. A good option for a Belt Sheath is to try to find a small and cheap fixed blade that comes with a sheath. The knife has a manual opening, but when opening it, it wants to open all the way. The main spring that holds the blade open applies pressure on the blade through the opening, but it doesn't assist the opening. There is a portion of the Tanto Blade right above the hilt that is serrated. The plain blade is smooth the entire way."

        "answer": "Yes, it will work with ALL calibers, and why I purchased it. It uses a strong magnet to attach to the \"outside\" of the barrel rather the other models that attach within the barrel. The obvious advantage of surface attachment over internal attachment is that there is no intrusion of the sensitive crown portion on the barrel!",

You stick it on the end of the barrel using the magnet and turn on the switch. You adjust your scope until the reticle lines up with the laser dot.  After that, you will be on paper, so remove the laser sight and begin normal sight adjustments using live ammo.",

This product could fit on an m4 tactical rail such as the black ops m4 viper airsoft gun. The product will not fit on an AR-15 carry handle without a rail. The only exceptions are A-3s which are specifically designed to have the carrying handles removed. The product is a 3 minute of angle with a low setting that produces a very small dot."

This product does not require you to drill any holes for use. It comes with an internal clamp that fits around the bottom and is tightened with a screw. This product will fit the Model 44 Taurus. This product isn't for use with the Judge 4510 TKR. This product is a bit tricky when installed on a Taurus R352 based on your hand size and grip where your pinky finger rests. There are two frame sizes and you will get different results with use depending on these things. This product will fit a Taurus 617 .357 without any problems."

      "The dimensions of this product are  18.25\" x 9\" x 5.25\". This product will hold a tablet and may hold a small laptop but you can check the manufacturer website to see if it's listed on the items that will fit. A 1911 handgun could fit in the concealed carry weapon compartment of this bag. A Moab 10 can be attached to this bag as the product comes with the straps to attach it. A small pair of binoculars will probably fit in the small pouch on the strap of this product. A microfiber towel and small bottle of lotion will probably fit in the pack but if the large storage area is over packed it would limit what could fit in the small compartment. The small pouch on the strap is not removable. This product is made in Vietnam."

The Okuma CLX-300L reel may be too small for this rod; another reel that is one size bigger by Okuma would be better. The tip of this rod has a roller and the material is aluminum. The rod is one piece and includes a case. The rod is strong enough to be used with steel lines. This rod is good for trolling type reels like the Tiagra Penn International. This rod works with braided lines. This rod works perfectly with the 6/0 Penn Senator reel."

      "To fold this cart, press the button at the top of the wheel shaft at the bottom to fold the front tire under the main bar. Then move the latch up to the top loop, which will fold the handle down and back wheels toward the shaft. The umbrella holder on this cart can be removed and re-attached easily. This cart can hold a stand bag. The straps are elastic and can stretch. To collapse this bag, find the red gadget in the middle that connects the bottom with the top. Pull it up and toward yourself. That will make the cart fold. To open it, pull it toward yourself again. This cart is easier to push up to a 20% grade than to pull it. The spacing for this cart is for normal-sized bags and wouldn't likely fit a junior golf bag. To fit in this cart, a bag needs to be at least 32.5 inches tall. This cart is not electric, so it doesn't have a battery. However, it is a very good cart for the price."

Luxury gel pads will fit this product and will reduce pressure on the back of the thighs as well as provide comfort. The pads of this seat move with the pedaling of the rider because one pad will pivot downward as the rider extends their leg to push a pedal while the other pad rises slightly. The size of the seat is irrelevant due to its lack of appeal. Mounting the bicycle seat on any bicycle is possible if they have a typical seat mount or with an adapter mount."

In the carrier the tent measures about 2 feet long. There is ventilation where the rainfly is on top and there are mesh panels.  The window in the front can be opened as well. The tent could be used for wild life photography, but keep in mind that it has a shiny finish and could spook wildlife. Note that the tent doesn't retain much heat because it is thin nylon but it blocks wind well. The tent can be used indoors as well as outdoors."

It does not have a pouch or any other accessories, but it does hold the knife very securely. I have heard some reviews of the plastic \"D\" ring on the bottom of the sheath as cheap, but I tried to cut mine off and it took a hacksaw to get through it. Ontario Spec Plus Gen II knives are affordable because they are simple with simple sheaths, but the knives themselves are high quality and tougher than almost anything you will use them for.

The wire is in line with the center black line of the bezel.  Many persons may not see the wire and the distant object simultaneously because the wire is only inches from your eye, its very close.   The slit also then works then like a pinhole eyeglass or Inuit snow goggle allowing the user to focus easier and see the wire too.",

Compasses built for the northern part of the earth, above the equator have the needle \"balanced\" so that it is level when the compass is level.  If you buy a compass built by a company located  in the southern hemisphere the south end of the needle will probably float hi as compared to the north end.  Cammenga manufactures here in the USA so their compass card  is balanced for our local.  This military marching compass is really so  easy to use.  The body of  the compass has a nice straight edge along one side making it very useful when you want to align a map to any one of its three coordinates.  The military has used this compass for many years and it is a proven performer.  Note, if you want lots of features such as inclination, mirror imaging with see through hole, adjustable declination,  etc. there are lots of  much more complicated compasses available.All compasses point to the same place, magnetic north, no matter who made the compass.  However, the earth rotates on an axis running through the North Pole to the South Pole.  This axis is not magnetic, it is geographic and called \"true north.\"  Magnetic north is off to one  side of the axis, though this is a somewhat simple explanation.  If any compass points other than magnetic north then it has been adjusted for declination, the difference between true north and magnetic.  Declination varies depending on your location on the earth's  surface.\n\n\n\n    Timothy, The effect the earth has on the needle of a compass is different in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere.

      "This product is a 27 Clam Shell compass used for sighting the course you intend to follow. The Earth's magnetic poles are located above the surface of the Earth. When a compass is in the Northern Hemisphere, the magnetic pole is above the compass and pulls up on the North end of the needle. In the Southern Hemisphere the same is true for the South end of the needle. The compass is balanced by adding weight to the North end of the needle for compasses used in the Northern Hemisphere. The sight wire shows you what direction you are going using the magnetic poles as a guide. The compass has a jeweled dial which is faster and more accurate than a liquid dial. The compass mirror has a diameter of 5 cm. The length of the compass is 12.5 cm  when open and 7.5 cm when closed. The width of the compass is 5.6 cm. The product weighs 145 grams including the strap.  Declination is indicated on MGRS maps. Instructions are included."

The image is very sharp, has no color aberrations, and the view is clear from edge to edge, not just in the middle like some monoculars. I personally love the reticle and the fact that this has a separate adjustment to focus the reticle. I wish I had one of these back when I was in Armor in the army. The view is much clearer than the high dollar binoculars we had back then.",

      "The Vortex Optics solo is not a range finder. It makes a great pocket size spotting scope. The optics can be used to make a good guess on range. The Votrex Optics solo does not have night vision. The special feature of this scope is the reticulated display to help measure distance. The close of range of the scope is comparable to a night force rifle. The Votrex Optics scope would be a good unit for ranging without a laser. After some practice, you should be able to range from point blank. The glass on this product is remarkable. At 100 yards you will be able to identify .308 holes in a color change splatter target. Ranging a small to medium sized animal with this scope works really well. The Vortex Optics solo has an adjustable eyecup that can be adjusted for either eye and if you are using glasses the eyecup can be twisted up. To find the measurements and weight, visit the Vortex Optics website for more information."

Be careful as it is larger than many states allow for carry.

      "The NIKON 1in M-223 Scope Mount\u2019s distance from outside is 4-1/2\" and 3-3/16\" from the inside. The mount's height from the rail top to the scope tube bottom is about 23mm. The mount is high enough to prohibit front sight obstruction. The M-223 Mount version lacks MOA built-in, but the M-223 XR Mount contains 20 MOA built-in for a long shooting range. The front site post is invisible when looking through the scope. The products work effectively with restaff but are costly. The scope is the best alternative because it is cheap, well made, and easy to dial.The mount works on Nikon scope, even when the action turret is on as long as one has a military-style rail on the weapon. The m-223 is unable to co-witness magnified optics. For iron backup sights, consider either a quick release scope or red dot mount."

Low cut boots that are like regular shoes are fitied down to the centimeter but work boots or hiking boots have extra room to strap your knife on. Hope this helps. And the thickness of the knife isn't that thick but it's made in China so I'm very disappointed.... Ifeel I were you I'd get anew American made boot knife.

      "This item comes as pictured. The four tubes all together hold about eighty-eight brasses and can also be used by sliding bullets into position. On the pistol caliber, the dies are carbide and do not lube. The seating die will crimp the brass depending on how high or low you have it set. You can change out the dies to load different calibers, and if you change the die, you can reload 30-06 with this press. This product comes with a .40 die which is the same as 10mm. If it is a large pistol primer, this is not a setup for 10mm. It has a small pistol primer set up for .40. You will need to purchase the die set for the .223 Remington along with a shell plate that holds the brass."

I would suggest you go to web site ,shootandreload.com, and read what the gentleman writes about the lee loadmaster.I have been reloading for more than 50 years and agree with his opinion about lee products.  If you have a little patience and medium mechanical ability you will be fine with the loadmaster. I have two of them and like the results just fine and I'm rather picky about my reloads.I Hope this helps.",

The trigger also rotates the magazine and therefore have a little bit of resistance. This product is used just to target practice and loads .177 pellets or 4.5 mm steel bb's in their respective 8 shot cylinder magazines. Laser to the gun is universal while the rail mount and flashlight are a bit too large. This product is made with polymer upper and lower with metal parts inside and the CO2 is odorless. This means you may want to change a different cartridge source as the gas may be contaminated."

The product is a day-glow green paint on both the front and rear that does not need to absorb energy as it does not give off light but reflects light in both dark and daylight conditions. The sights have titanium inserts that are quite bright at ends and the front of the rear sights are 90 degrees to the side. This site will fit the G17, G19, G26, G22, G23, and the G27, and is comparable to the default Glock sight. The best installation tools for these sights would be a brass punch and a hammer."

A higher feet per second rating, which is rated at the muzzle, would be better for longer range. Faster speed would mean more distance. This gun is not Co2. It is break barrel spring piston operated. The dimensions of this air pistol are 12 by 6 by one and a half. The outside of this air pistol is all plastic. The grip is rubbery plastic. The internals are metal, including the barrel. The barrel is shrouded in plastic. The gun is well-made, light and durable but heave enough to not feel hollow or cheap. This air pistol is too weak to be used on sparrows. A CO2 handgun or pump with more power would be better suited. The sight rail of this air pistol cannot be used for the real buck mark because they are different."

        "answer": "As far as ab exercises, the regular ab roller wheels are said to be the best tool to use for total core development. This particular roller will also give yu that overall development, but will lessen your core muscle reaction when you return from being extended, due to the built in coil assist. This, all rollers, also assist in arm development. Overall, the roller are better than crunches. I use the regular roller and this one. Push-ups and pull-ups are for chest, arm, core, and back development that could work along side the roller for total development. I hope this helps.",

        "answer": "I would say it does not really compare to pull-ups or push-ups. You can incorporate more arm usage if you are very fit and able to reach more as you roll forward. I think it is more effective than traditional crunches, especially for the obliques and lower abdominal muscles. It is somewhat similar to planks, an exercise in which you use your body weight.",

      "This standard box set comes with a skewer. This is the second generation rock and roll trainer (T-2300). The Riser Ring comes without this and needs to be ordered separately. This product is able to lock the actual \"rock n roll\" effect.  When peddling, there is some compliance side to side allowing a more realistic feel. This can work with a MTB 29 inch. This is the latest version and it comes with a skewer and a cone cup as listed on the Kurt Kinetic site. The riser ring is separate. This is a great trainer."

      "This product does not have an adjustment to change its direction, but this can be easily solved by positioning the trap in the appropriate direction. This item may support Daisy Shatterblast Refill Disks, but is intended for throwing full sized targets. A board or tire is not required to mount this product, as it either pushes into the ground or may sit on top of something. The device is spring is loaded. When the pedal is stepped on, and as further pressure is applied, it will release and launch the target into the air. Parts for this product are sold by the manufacturer. This product is able to be used by one person. However, aiming carefully becomes a challenge, so it is recommended to have a second person to step on it while the other shoots. This product can be placed on a table as long as someone stands there to operate it. This product is designed to throw standard sized clay targets."

      "This product does not have a compressor, it is a thermoelectric cooler hose that needs to be plugged into the car or using an inside outlet, as this product has an AC adaptor.  Most cars have power flowing to the cigarette lighter. A one hundred Ah battery will last up to 20 hours if the cooler draws its maximum of 5.0 amps. Watts is 5 amps at 12 volts, so using the standard formula P=EI, wattage is 60. The P65 model has a heat function that is similar to the P27, you simply have to flip over the connector to heat.Meat is kept as cool as it would if it were in a standard refrigerator. If unplugged overnight, it is recommended that you have ice packs in the cooler and a blanket on top of the lid for insulation, and your food will stay cold and fresh for the next day."

      "Two adults can fit under this tent comfortably with room left for a child or small adult to lie on a blanket behind them. Depending on the position of the sun, the umbrella casts a large shadow and a third or fourth chair can be used to enjoy the shade. This pole is slightly smaller than a typical patio umbrella. It will tighten whatever screws hold it on the patio stand. This umbrella fits in a screw in the ground holder. To secure it into sand/ soil, purchase a plastic mallet to pound it in the ground. It can be used as a normal umbrella. This product needs to be used with a typical standard height fold up chair and it is restricted as to how far back you could place the chair due to the slope of the umbrella. This product is about 8 feet in size when opened. It will accommodate about 4 lawn chairs inside. The instructions say it can be used standing up but an anchor is not provided. When lying down it gets very hot under it and using it standing up provides some air flow. The sport umbrella website has replacement parts including the screw cap."

      "The stem of this umbrella is not made for placing in surfaces such as beach sand but it works well for level ground. The pole and ribs of the umbrella are made from metal and are painted white. The screws are plastic. As a rain umbrella it will only work for a light rain. It is less effective in a heavy rain. The umbrella does not include a clamp for attaching to a bleacher. The height of the umbrella can be adjusted from 3' to 8'. It opens to 60'' wide and has room for 2 adults. The umbrella is 8 pounds. The umbrella is easily collapsible with a push of a button. Despite its compactness and easy storage, it provides ample shade for 1-2 people. The umbrella is not tall enough to be used with a patio table and chairs. To secure the umbrella in windy conditions, metal rods are provided to pin it to the ground. A cooler or bags can be placed near the base but wind over 15mph may pose problems."

This item has enough space to use the bench for dumbbell chest flies with the bench flat. This product has a length and girth of 30\" x 16\" with a total of 47\" and can be used for a larger guy. This can also be used with standard 1\" hole weights on the leg lift as the bench will primarily hold the size. Bar and weights are not included upon purchase. Item was shipped in good condition."

You could add other exercises to keep the hamstrings exercised thoroughly.  Google \"straight bar vs hex bar benefits\" and you will find a slew of information.",

        "answer": "I'd have to give a qualified \"yes\".  I used my Shrug bar to rehab after a convention deadlift injury late last year.  Because the bar moves through your body's center, there's far less change of injury.  If you are training for competition/powerlifting/crossfit meet, however, you'll still want to train conventional deadlift.  For most of the athletes I coach, who are not competitive lifters, however, I am comfortable recommending the shrug bar as a suitable replacement for conventional deadlifts.  Hope that helps!Clintwww.BarbellsandBourbon.com",

I made the mistake of hammering in tent stakes with the brass pommel of a Buck Ranger a long time ago.  I put dings in the brass and I always regretted it.  Use a rock if nothing else.  Don't pry with a knife, either.  I've seen them with tips broken off.  People who abuse their knives don't appreciate them!",

I own a variety of knives, and respectfully recomend that you consider the Gerber Silver Trident.  It has a flat stainless steel pommel [MADE FOR POUNDING] and a special grip material that absorbs the impacts.  If you want a high quality, heavy duty ,American made knife that was also DESIGNED to be used as a hammer, it would be hard to beat the Silver Trident.  Both knives are of very high quality and can usually be found similarily priced.",

      "This product could most likely be mounted on a front receiver hitch on a truck and comes in 2 or 4 bike version. The pin that holds the rack to the hitch does not have a hole but it does have a 1/2 inch bolt and washer. The back wheel would not fit with this rack because it is 4 1/2\" which is too wide. The product does not tilt instead only the upright part holds down and the wheel holders fold toward the top of the frame. The arms on this product do not have locks and the pin for the hitch on this rack is threaded."

If this product uses the same type of recoil rod and spring it should fit a Taurus PT92 with rail, but will not work in a compact INOX, because it is for full-size 92/96 series pistols. A full-size gun with this setup will work. Shorter length barrels need a shorter stroke rod and spring.

It has a short hose and a no-leak head (the part that attaches to the Schrader valve) that keeps the air in when attaching and removing. The short hose works well for me since the Schrader valve is located in a very tight location - between the frame and the left saddlebag. Even with my big fingers, I can easily attach and remove the hose.I hope these comments help.",

This product contains the following colors: green and red. The rectangular sized pads are green, and the round ones are red. This product is activated by bending a metal disc inside. This product contains a nearly unlimited number of charges due to the fact that you are freezing and melting sodium acetate. Therefore, it will continue to work until the bag itself is no longer functional. This product will stay warm for approximately one hour.

      "The combo in Air Magnum Combo Air Rifle refers to the scope. The power of the air rifle is enough to penetrate a 1/16\" sheet of galvanized steel. The pellet rifle has superior FPS to the Ruger Air Hawk Combo with 850-900+ FPS using 22 call pellets. The air rifle includes an excellent Ruger-made scope specifically made for air rifles. Avoid scopes not rated for air rifles. Large is also referred to as .177 caliber which distinguishes it from 22 cal. Artillery hold is when the front of the air rifle is left to sit in your hand without any attempt to control recoil. The effort will lead to inaccuracy, so it is better to let the rifle rest on any object and squeeze the trigger. True artillery rounds above 20 cal. The air rifle will be effective at eliminating any small animals or vermin. Use caution. This product is primarily manufactured in China, but some are made in the USA."

You can squish the mattress to make it fit where you need it but only a little bit and if you are sleeping two on it, and one of you gets up the other could be rolled off.  If I were you I would do some measurements of your truck bed.  This mattress is a little easier to conform to something than a standard air mattress.",

This product is good for a 5'2\" user as there are many different adjustments to adapt to. You can add more accessories but it comes with everything you need to start. The color is almost all black with a small amount of blue in the logo. This is a youth bow so the draw length is just 12-24\" and the pull weight is only 29 pounds which isn't legal for hunting. It's good to start children with, though."

You need to feed the rods through the shelter in an X fashion hoping there wont be a gust of wind while you do it. Easiest with two people. No reason to take on a cruise.

Screw into the holes on the back to keep the back cover from sliding. The support bar in the back of the chair basically becomes a handle to carry it. Be sure to use the 2 little screws to fasten the cloth portion of the chair to the frame. There is a folding hook under the chair. The back is very supportive and stable even without using the hook. This is the wide version of the embroidered stadium seat. The hook attaches to the bleachers."

This product is just a drop in part replacement for the connector and doesn't require any grinding but you must take apart the trigger group. This product will work on small and large framed glocks except for the G42 because of the shorter connector. The purchase of this product is enough to replace the connector and goes right in when installed without the need for springs when replacing the part."

All of the wide mouth lids screw OUTSIDE the pukas.  So I ended up buying a 32 oz wide mouth hydroflask.  Sorry I couldn't help.  May you have a blessed Memorial Day :)",

The cap is leakproof like Contigo bottles, however the ice will not stay solid as long as it does with the original lid. The flexible ring around the neck allows the flat cap to just pop off and a straw is able to be placed in the lid. The cap can be placed on the top rack of the dishwasher. There is a removable silicone gasket around the inner edge."

      "You need a MIL-STD rail for this to mount. Most AEGs modeled after the M4/AR-15/M16 platform will have the type of rail this mounts to. The dimensions are 3 1/8 in long over all, the height is 2 1/8 in, and the rail is 2 1/4 in long. It's set up for a Picatinny rail and works with a weaver. The dial on the right hand side should be turned to the letter R."
