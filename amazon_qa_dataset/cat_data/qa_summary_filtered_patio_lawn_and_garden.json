A smoker does not need to be added to the unit as the charcoal side can also function as a smoker using the preferred wood chips. The grill's total width is approximately 70 inches, with the addition of a removable 3 inch handle. The heat sources do not combine because they are completely separate fire boxes and grilling surfaces. The charcoal side has an ash drawer that easily pulls out for cleanup and contains venting below the lid which helps with smoke circulation."

      "The Waka Waka Solar Lamp is a solar-powered light that allows you to use the sun to charge the device during daylight hours to allow the product to hold that charge and stay on once the sun has set. The product has a small LED light at the top that indicates the rate it is charging that blinks using several flashes to tell you the remaining charge simply by looking at it. When the product loses power, it will cut itself off, then automatically come on by itself when the battery is fully charged. The solar light also has the option to use an external charger such as w wall outlet or car charger. The manufacturers\u2019 website suggests that you leave the product on, and it will stay on its highest setting for about 30 seconds and that the product is intended for once-a-month use for emergency lighting."

        "answer": "The unit that I have did not come with a remote control and I do not know if one is available.  I would check the Hayward website.  It does require a regular plug for the power transformer, with the unit plugs into so it can operate on low voltage and doesn't draw a lot of energy.  Transformer has a 10-12ft plug and the unit has a 50ft plug.  Unit automatically shuts off after the estimated cleaning time, which is nice.",

The product is 24 v.  29322-88Wh., so it is the enhanced battery model which will hold a charge for a period of time but after a few weeks it is best to recharge before use. The tank is very small and uses any make of chain saw lube oil. There is an electric motor turning a chain cutting a limb so there is bound to be some vibration."

All that said its easier to move around than you might think with the position of the handles. One healthy person can move it short distances such as off the back of a pickup truck to a camp site 15 feet away. Of course 2 people make it much easier.See my review. You can use 2 hands to carry the unit. The Honda 2000 is awarkward to handle because you can only use 1 hand. Dan",

The steel legs are powdered finished and rust resistant. Bolts can be loosened a little to adjust legs. It requires two people, one to hold position and other to tighten bolts. The brand is Mainstays and there is not a hole on the top for an umbrella. There is not a clear weight limit but can hold up well with a 230 pound person."

This guide works to keep it off the sidewalk as long as it is pulled backwards so it doesn't widen the cut. The handle is not reversible so a left handed person will be walking behind the blade side. Be sure to wear goggles for protection. The blade will last longer in grass and shorter in soil. The replacement blades are 7 1/2 inches and are  Black & Decker EB-007 Edger Hog Heavy-Duty Edger brand. This product can make a small 4-5 inch deep trench that is 1 inch wide. The handle length can be adjusted by the 2 knob that will give you an extra 2 inches. The edging feature for this works very well when the back wheels are on a solid surface."

      "This product is intended for moles, gophers, mice and rats. There isn't a way to set bait in the rear trap to lure but this product could work for roof rats and voles if set up properly. The mole cat kit will only work on time on large rats and squirrels. All of the working parts of this product are metal besides the tube which is plastic. The baiting process works well with squirrels and those who have used this product have captured over 20 in 3 weeks. This product will not work well with chipmunks."

Just press in on both sides of the cap, then it comes off and you can remove old spool and replace with new one.  Just gently remove tape on new spool and feed line thru eyelet.  Then put cap back on you are good to go.",

      "This product works great and is a really perfect purchase, according to the PSI in their comparison sheets. It has a diaphragm pump and at the base of the pump the head is exposed at the bottom and it has an internal pump so it will not leak on your back. For salt and brine mixture, first, you need to dilute the mixture to fit through the nozzle/hose. The pressure on the stream can spray at least 18 to 20 feet high. The rubber gaskets will degrade with bleach present in this Sprayer. The 61900 has nicer thicker more cushiony straps, the backpack straps come with this device. Not sure if anyone found spare parts needed for the Chapin. The pump handle is reversible. All in all, this seems to be a good quality."

      "This product is used to prevent moisture from collecting in the ash which will cause rust on the bottom. If you leave the grill in the open, this could cause rust without the cover. It may work for Weber Smokey Mountain but there is a product made specifically for that grill type. This product will cover the grill, but won't cover the side handles when it is attached. It has a cover that covers the sides adequately and leaves 6 inches uncovered. And there probably isn't a difference in the two besides the red grill being used in their logo and possibly the white grill being used for older models. You can also visit the Weber website to have a better understanding of the difference between the red and white grills. And it doesn't have a California cancer warning on it."

The dethatcher should work with any riding mower and hooks behind the tractor to dethatch the yard. The inside tray will hold about 2 cinder blocks amount of weight and has a width of 8 inches. The dethatcher probably won't work on lawn moss or if the grass has live roots. The unit comes with a hitchpin and should work with any riding mower."

With the lid down, it is 10\" inside and can fit a chicken. There may be a size issue with a beer can underneath the chicken. This product comes with a drip tray that sits towards the back that will catch drippings but doesn't sit completely under the burners for all of it to be caught for clean up. It only covers about 30% of the underside of the grill. The side shelves are not collapsible and one of the sides has a side burner.

Obviously these numbers are based on maximum output form the charger (100 amps).

If it is an inverter generator then this isn't necessary. The item can be used for a battery bank (600ah) with 6 batteries. A battery has to have about 600 cold cranking amps to turn over a car motor. The product charges and when it doesn't need to charge it goes into float mode. There isn't an on- off switch. You can expect about 11 to 12 amps at full current operation. The item has a standard 3 prong for plugging it into a trailer. The difference between this and the PMBC-100 which is also a 100A battery charger, is that the PMBC-100 include 6 ft. cables with clamps. This item will run led flood lights from a generator without a battery."

The product can be used on sand that is deep and fine and is useful for the beach and would also have no trouble managing on a gravel path. The assembly requires the wagon to fold into its carry bag, or you have the option to pull it if you correctly align two of the wheels for this wagon to be pulled when collapsed, though this may not be as comfortable. The cushions are not too high as they would fall over the top, but this product has just the canvas cover over the steel frame so it would not be comfortable for prolonged sitting. The product has great carrying space, and would easily carry a medium-sized dog like a Golden Retriever."

It broke the wire connection again during the first use so I quit using it and bought the Ryobi, what an improvmant, for any amount of additional money, all the Ryobi One+18 volt tools use the same battery.

Depending on how the chainsaw is held, it may feel heavier. Comfort will depend on the individual strength. Changing the tension of the chain is not difficult. Use a screwdriver to tighten the chain. A generic 8 inch chain can be used to replace the chain on the chainsaw. The chainsaw should be capable of cutting the small fronds on robelinni palms. The pole is made of metal and does not bend while using. Check the manufacturer website for more information."

My formula for algae success is shock with chlorine powder AND use swamp treat or yellow out plus a.clarifier while running pump 24/7.  This works within days and the algae at the bottom is gone with rover the vacuum. I use it daily, every day and would not be without one. By far the best purchase I made.",

It would be difficult to capture more than one bug at a time and also bugs that are moving due to the vacuum's small opening. This product will not capture anything larger than a stinkbug, beetle, small bee or small spiders. Centipedes of 5 to 6 inches will either not fit in the small opening or be torn apart like a delicate moth and picking up roaches would be too difficult due to their large size. To prevent the captured bug from crawling out of the BugZooka there is a trap door that closes after the bug is sucked in. The bug can be released by removing the chamber and tipping the bug out. The BugZooka is intended to capture bugs intact to release outside. It does not require holding a trigger but rather a switch you just push and release to suck the bug in."
