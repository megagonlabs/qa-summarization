The S4 pulls 1.8amps at its full draw and its oem cable and charger are rated for 2.1 if i remember correctly.",

      "This item can be mounted to multiple cars as it is not hard to detach. The mount location must be smooth and flat, and kept clean for the next use. Installation requires twisting the base to lock and unlock the item. This item has a large grip that will fit iPhone cases. This product will fit an Otterbox case as long as the space between the holders is no more than 3 inches wide. This product successfully suctions to a dashboard in a car. This product does not have a \"release phone\" button as the item can just be pulled from the dashboard. This item can be attached by taking an old credit card and pressing it between the surface and the suction foot. This item does not include a charging cable, as it is only a car dashboard mount. There are multiple ways to connect audio in a car so the cable is not necessary."

      "The cover is made specifically for the Galaxy tab 3 7\". This item won't fit the 10 inch tablet because your camera is on the corner and it will block it even if it's a seven inch screen. This item does not have an opening below the volume and power controls or an opening on the back for the speaker. The magnets don't appear to be strong enough to hold the tab closed. It pops open once it is used as a stand. This product has space for the front facing camera and still has the open spaces for everything else to fit in."

      "This phone holder fits an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus even with an Otterbox case, as the sides widen to 3.5 inches.  The side arms close enough to grip most phones securely and work with the iPhone 4s and 5. It also works with the Samsung Galaxy 3 and Samsung Note. This kit is furnished with a suction-based dashboard mount.  The swivel ball is  17mm which is the same ball size that is used on the Garmin Nuvi devices.  Be aware that the bottom feet are too high up to use with the usb port so it is not a perfect match with the micro usb charging  end. Also not that the vent hooks are weak and break easily so be careful. Tilt the air vents to the left, right, up or down for a better view."

        "answer": "There is no clip. It is form fitted to seat snugly in place when fully in the holster, it only takes a slight amount of pressure to remove the phone. It can be done with one hand without thought. It rarely comes un-seated while in the holster, only if you really catch it on something. It has never fell out of the holster as it has to slide straight up until it clears the center tabs.  This is the smoothest case I have ever owned as far as removing and replacing it in the holster.",

        "answer": "Since the fit is snug, it's quite a pull. I wear my phone clip sidewards. This allows me with my right hand just to slide it out and slide it back. If it's vertical, (phone can be vertical or horizontal) I find it harder. The horizontal positioning of the phone is better since movement is more physiological. No need to move a clip. The fit is perfect for the phone.",

The texture makes it easy to hold and the material doesn't slip on smooth surfaces. The clip on this product swivels and does not serve as a stand, but the cover and phone case does. It also fits the phone well, but the only way the phone can be placed into the holster is with the screen facing in. While the phone is in the case and holster, the phone jack is still accessible positioned at the top. The phone would slide in from the top face and slides out by pulling from the bottom towards the top. If the case is properly loaded into the holster, the phone doesn't fall out."

The plastic interchangeable plate is mainly for styling and covers most of the outer TPU case (rubber-like material) that houses the phone.  With that plate on, your phone will be sliding all over the place.  You can choose to use the case without the plate, but I still don't think the TPU cover will provide enough of a grip to your dash.",

You would need to know what frequency the company uses in order to use the phone, but if it is higher than 3G you should purchase a Blu Vivo which is a different version of this phone that works worldwide. This product works with TMobile up to 3G network connection. This product works on 900 band on 3G but the product description proves it may not be the same one rated for the GSM Arena. This product is the model D910A, but there are multiple models sold that can be found on the GSM Arena website. The purchase of this product includes a USB cord, wall charger, and an animated cover."

      "This case is a great new hybrid that protects better than many other cases and it\u2019s super slim as well. None of the buttons are metal, and this case does not come with a screen or glass protector. You will need to buy this separately. There is a volume tab on the side of the case where the volume on your phone will be at... so the actual volume tab on your phone will be covered by the case's volume tab. The plastic part does not scratch or scuff easily. It is not fading, and the buttons still look shiny. This product has no issues when used with a 3.0 charger."

I've bench press, cycled, do sit-ups, you name it with them and I've had no problems. It's pretty solid. The bass quality is probably one of the best, compared to the jaybird which only has treble quality. Depending on how you twist and angle your earpiece hole, towards your ears, you will either get stronger or mild bass quality. Hope that helps.",

It has a kickstand on both sides that allows sideway viewing. With the double layers and for the protection of the phone it does not have a wrist strap hole. This case has a strong chemical that smells like new and also did not have any fall off in the 1st 2 weeks of use  (Unlike the 1st. B.G., AND its replacement! ). If you want to save big bucks, and actually protect your LG with a case that works & plays hard.",

It has to be paired with your cell phone, just like a standard Blue Tooth device.  It charges through a standard USB connection on the unit, using the charger at home, a car charger, or the USB on your computer.  Hope this helps.",

Also, if I park the car in the garage, the BlueAnt answers incoming calls in the car when I and the phone are in the house and if I try to make a call from inside the house the outgoing call goes through the BlueAnt, so I have to turn it off manually when I am at home.",

This speaker did not come with a charger as a car Bluetooth does and cannot pull the address book from the phone. The device will go to 'sleep' after leaving the car, otherwise, it will connect and stay connected if your phone is remarkably close to where you are with the phone, as the product has an auto-on feature. The product comes with two sizes of clips that are easily interchangeable to clip onto the visor and will also plug into your desktop computer into a USB drive and it will charge at your desk."
