I have found that pushing is preferred if the path is up hill.  It's a great cart and very sturdy.  Love the fold flat feature.  it would be great for carting the dog crate and a chair.

      "This product's measurement is 26.8\" in length and a width of16.1\". It is small and sturdy enough to serve as a storage and move small stuff.  It can be used to move items like a dolly as long as someone is there to help keep it there as the bed is not too long and the handle needs to be up while the wheels are down. The majority of the guitar case may be able to rest on this. Its wheels dimension has 1 inch wide and inches high and the wheels can be folded.  The product is better suited to be pulled around rather than being pushed around. The preference of pushing can work if some practice is put in. The product's handles are resistant to breaking, depending on the surface it is traveling on. A smooth level floor should be able to handle heavy loads like 200 pounds while uneven surfaces or that of an incline may need additional material such as a rope. To make sure that the item can handle the weight, refer to the manufacturer's specs. The item is unsuitable for gravel and yard movement. It should be used on smooth surfaces so the best option is to avoid using the wheels on grass."

      "This product comes with the light fixture and it is best to have a 240v to 110v step down transformer. The light switch toggle on the product semi becomes obsolete if it is left permanently on. The remote requires it to be \"on\" so that it can control the fan. The product comes with a required down rod for installation. It lacks the option to be installed flush to the ceiling and only has an option for a longer down rod. The height is 15\" from the ceiling to the bottom of the globe. A longer pole may be necessary if the ceiling used because it is sloped. The fan stretches about 12 inches from its install rod to the bottom of its dome."

If old, the studs may not be in the correct position for the chair to be used on the short wall so you may want to consider anchoring the chair on the long wall. If new construction, we highly recommend placing blocking in-between the studs (on end wall) so that you assure of secure anchoring.  Hope this helps!",

      "This product is made of high quality metal and wood. It has a flat metallic grey color that is darker than brushed nickel. The back of the seat is flat and 3/4\" from the wall where it mounts. The teak wood holds up well but should be wipes down periodically with teak oil to maintain the darker color. It will lighten in color without this regular maintenance. The top two slats slide out completely. There is a small space behind the third. It is a very functional seat and can be easily cleaned with a moveable showerhead. Installation requirements are the same regardless of shower wall composition. The items must be fastened to 2x4 framing members within the wall with heavy screws. Unless you are exceedingly lucky with placement of wall framing members in the existing area, you will need to open the wall and add additional framing members. The same is true for grab bars. Be aware that you can pinch your fingers when folding the seat if you are not careful. You will need solid blocking behind the seat as the holes will not line up on the studs."

Just a suggestion, tho: I'd really recommend that you use an LED bulb for this lamp since it doesn't heat up. Also, using a 100W equivalent CFL worked best for me in terms of lighting (that is, if you want your light to be bright but also very relaxing for the eyes) and this bulb, specifically, is really durable and energy efficient.

You would need wick material or a suction bulb along with the soldering iron for certain projects to work. It comes with one fin and one course sanding drum. It is not a sealed unit and water could easily seep in and ruin the motor. You get all the sleeve sizes listed in the product description. This product has a one year warranty."

        "answer": "To answer your question directly, it is not madatory but it does help. Tinning the tip(s) only takes a small amount of solder and helps the solder heat and flow easier. Just allow the iron to get hot, apply a bit of solder and then wipe clean. Use a rosin core solder with a thickness appropriate for the job. On circuit boards use a thin diameter (.093 or smaller) and then larger as the wire diameter increases. Hope this helps, I was a NASA certified solderer 40+ years ago when I worked in the R&D; Lab on the Apollo program.",

      "This product works very well for soldering circuit boards and works on 110 amps fine. The power plug is 2 pronged and not grounded. This item is not a de-soldering tool as you would need wick material or a suction bulb along with the soldering iron for that to work. The replacement tips are 1/8\" and fit well but it helps to tin the tip. What solder to use depends on the application but the temperature is not adjustable."

They don't fit the 11240. The 11240 takes what are called SDS MAX bits, which take a much larger diameter bit."

      "The product has a 12-inch length from the floodlight to the power source but there is no automatic sensor to turn the light on or off at sunset and is mostly classified as a floodlight more than a spotlight. This product requires a 12-volt power supply and does not have a rectifier. According to the manufacturer's website, the product is rated at 110 lumens for a 3-watt LED. The LED bulbs should last for years but are replaceable. The product specs say Halogen bulbs, but it is a LED with great lights, but the splice connectors are not as good. The product has a cord that comes out of the base of the light support and should be attached to the stake and once it is placed in the ground, there is 8' to 10' of wire to make the connection."

You could order a special adaptor from a third party and hope it doesn't fall off. For less money both DeWalt and Milwakee make sanders that easily accept shop vac hoses.

      "This product is an orbital finishing sander used mainly for wood or plastic, compared to a disc sander which is used to reduce welds or heavy metal. The product is easy to connect to a shop vac through the port where the bag was connected. The voltage for this product is 110 volt AC. The port is about an inch and adaptor kits can be found for different sizes. The support grip has the ability to rotate and the knob unscrews enough to remove the band. It has an extra knob near the front and rear handle to make it super easy to use during long sanding periods. It comes with a cloth bag that fits on a 1/8th turn to release a hard rubber fitting and never falls off. It has a button in the handle to lock trigger on and a pad under the sanding disk that helps with maneuverability and command of the sander. Note that the product would take a long time to remove paint from steel."

      "After installing your receiver and transmitter, check the operation of your radio controls by moving approximately 35 feet back from the garage door, then press the transmitter button. Operation at this distance should be reliable. If you can't reprogram the remote, erase all the codes by holding down the Learn button on the motor unit for about 6 seconds or until the Learn light turns off. If you still can't program the remote after erasing all codes, reset the logic board in the motor unit by unplugging the garage door opener for one minute. If it is manufactured in 2011 or later, you can determine compatibility by the color of the \"learn\" button near the wiring terminals. If it is yellow it is not compatible. But if it is any other color, it is compatible. All Chamberlain garage door openers are compatible with Liftmaster.

      "This product is intended to measure the average temperature of your home. So, it makes sense to locate it in an average area of your home, away from spots that tend to have greater variations in temperature. That's usually an interior wall. To determine whether or not you have a C-wire, detach your thermostat from the wall, find the terminal labeled \"C\" and see if there's a wire attached to it. If there is, you're good to go with a smart thermostat installation. If not, look for electrician to determine the best path forward. If you see two wires coming out of it in the back you have a single pole. If there are four wires, you have a double pole. If you have more than four wires coming out of your thermostat, you most likely have a low voltage one, which would be used to control a central furnace, boiler, or something similar.  This item is compatible with 2 wire, low voltage HVAC systems that are either heat only systems or cooling only systems. The 12-volt system is powered by a battery (or in some cases, multiple batteries), when your thermostat batteries die, you will see a black screen, the thermostat will stop working, and the heating or cooling units will not work. If, after the change of batteries, the thermostat and the heating and cooling systems start working, then everything should be back to working as normal. Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. The normal body temperature is around 98.6 F (37 C). Hypothermia (hi-Poe-THUR-me-uh) occurs as your body. A millivolt heating system is usually a floor heater or a wall heater that doesn't use electricity; for example a gas fireplace or a gas powered wall heater.

According to RAB technical support, the lens can be reversed if it is protected from direct rain. This is a 39 watt 5100K Cool color temperature lamp with a 100,000 hour life based on LM-80 tests. The light is on a knuckle and may be angled down until your beam spread is not intrusive. The product has a 1/2 male pipe nipple mount and can mount to a photo cell in a back box. Check the manufacturer website for more information."

This won't charge on 220v for very long but can handle it for a few minutes. The impact driver would work well for lighter duty concrete or brick drilling.

      "A 4-hole sink is the most common kitchen sink. A 4-hole-sink faucet is like a 3-hole faucet (see above), with the addition of a soap dispenser or sprayer. A 1-hole sink accommodates only a single-hole faucet. There is no escutcheon or deck plate. Black can have a huge impact on a space making it feel at once both grounded and modern. Matte black faucets can look fantastic in any style of space from contemporary modern to rustic. \"Oil rubbed\" is a chemical finished applied to several metals, including bronze, to simulate an aged appearance. The finish partially protects the soft metal from damage, but isn't completely impenetrable to scratches. Most faucets that are made of zinc will say so on the box, sometimes indirectly. The phrase \"all-metal\" on the box tells you that parts of the faucet contain at least some zinc. If it's all brass, the box will say \"All brass\"."

Tap the button you wish to use and then press and hold the set button until the Mini Remote beeps. Make sure the device you wish to control is ON and then press and hold its set button until it double-beeps. Your Mini Remote will now control your INSTEON device.

Once you switch on the timer function, the candle will stay on for 5 hours and then remain off for 19 hours. This 24 hour cycle will repeat continuously until you switch the timer function off."

I did not find that necessary - 12ga is plenty for low voltage applications unless you have an exceptionally long run.  Remember, each terminal is a different voltage - basically allows you to boost voltage up from 12V for the longer runs (or, runs with more lights that draw more current).  This is a super device.

        "answer": "My sink measures 23 inches wide including the lip, and it is installed in a 30 inch sink cabinet. Remember, a 24 inch cabinet means that the outside width is 24 inches. So it depends - do you have just a sink front without side walls? Then maybe you can squeeze it in, but would have trouble getting the clips in place, if you need those. If you have a 24\" sink cabinet with 1/2 or 3/4 inch plywood box construction, then definitely not. A drop in style sink might give you a little more wiggle room.",

There is some minor work that needs to be done, but if the installer knows what they are doing, it's no problem. The grid is 19 1/2 inches long and 14 inches wide. The corners are curved to fit the Krauss sink precisely. The corners are all generously curved so if you are looking to fit something specific in there you will have to allow for that."

When we have the spray on, it does splash and when rinsing items, i often find the spatter gets on the coutertop and my shirt, so often i will use the spray only to clean off veggies and use the stream setting to rinse dishes.

      "This product's handle is 2 5/8\" tall, counting from the base. This sink head comes with a 3 hole plate, but there isn't a matching bronze hole cover for an existing 4th hole. This faucet will create a messy spray depending on the depth of your sink. Standard and shallow depth sinks will create a mess, so it is better to have a deep sink. This product's pullout head is covered in brushed nickel, but the inner parts and switch are plastic. The product works well and is solid. This products uses a Delta Diamond Seal that keeps water lead-free and free from contact with other contaminates. This product doesn't come with a pause button. It will continue to sprat until you switch it to the steady stream mode. The product handle doesn't need clearance behind it because it only moves forward and straight. There isn't back rotation towards the back. This product provides plenty of water in spray mode. The small size isn't a problem, and it provides sufficient water flow. Note that his faucet doesn't have Touch20 tech."

      "This product is good for testing all major appliances that are below 600V. This should cover modern LCD displays. This product doesn't measure temperature on it's own, but it comes with an adapter with hookups for diodes and thermocouples. It must be used with other Mastech multimeteres to read temperature. This product uses milavolt measurements in the range of 0.001v  to 2V. This product's input impedance isn't available. That information might be in the instructions. This product doesn't measure hertz frequency. A separate scope will be needed to measure hertz frequency. This product is capable of audible continuity. However it isn't loud in a typical shop environment, so it is better to use in quiet areas. The product's two leads are 30 inches each. The included probes come with a  removable rubber insulating tip and sturdy grips. This product's capacity tester has a 4.2.7 Capacitance Range Resolution Accuracy. Check the manual for more information"

      "The safe's inside dimensions are 5x10 inches of usable space. It is possible to get an extra half inch of space due to the pliable foam inside. The lid is spring loaded to open when the private code is entered. It will raise slightly, and must be manually opened the rest of the way. In an emergency, you can thrust into the opening. This product's manual provides instructions for how to reset the combo lock. It requires the use of an internal button to reset, and also comes with two keys. The product will be able to fit a 1911 pistol, but it will be a close fit This product is unable to store several sheets of 8 1/2 x 11\" of paper without bending them. The papers would have to folded to fit inside the case. This product doesn't have pre-drilled holes for mounting. This product is neither fire resistant or fire proof. A beeping sound is made when opened. Note that the safe does not have a silent operation mode."

        "answer": "I bought the Bosch MX30EK-35. It has the same hard case as the -33. If you were to buy the blades separately the -33 would cost $107.02, -35 $117.50. It doesn't make sense the way they price some things at Amazon, but the -35 is a great deal for me. I love the tool. Go to the Bosch web site and it will show the hard case that comes with -35 same as the -33.",

        "answer": "Not sure why the price is so much better.  I thought it (-35) would not come with a case so when it arrived with one I was surprised.  It has the same style case that is pictured in the -33.  As far as I'm concerned, its a great deal.  I'm a contractor and have had the Fien MultiMaster for around 4 years.  I would say it preforms a little better then the Bosch but It's not enough to make a real difference.",

Both of my fans are flush mounted (as close to the ceiling as possible), but they can be mounted with an extension if you have high ceilings.  When you say \"from the ceiling mount\" do you mean from the bottom of the ceiling plate that covers the hole in the ceiling?  If so, I can't measure from the bottom of that as the motor (which is below the ceiling plate cover) is much wider than the ceiling plate cover. I hope this helps.",

      "Philips LED bulbs with a warm glow dimming effect, dim just like traditional incandescent bulbs. They get warmer in tone as the light gets dim. Rotations may be clockwise or counterclockwise. Other LED bulbs simply get less bright, without the cozy glow. To control a remote-controlled ceiling fan without using the remote, add a pull cord to the pull switch on the motor module. The pull cord can be purchased from a hardware store or garden and patio shop, while the tools needed are already in most households. You may need a light kit to install your fan. If you do not need a light kit, a switch housing cap will be inside the original Hunter box. Ceiling fans should be installed, or mounted, in the middle of the room and at least 7 feet above the floor and 18 inches from the walls. If ceiling height allows, install the fan 8 - 9 feet above the floor for optimal airflow. Most standard mount fans that hang from a down rod will put the blades about 12\" from the ceiling making them appropriate for rooms with ceilings that are 8 feet or higher. Flush mount fans are designed for rooms with low ceilings that are less than 8 feet. The generally accepted rule for hanging dining room chandeliers is that the bottom of the fixture should hang between 30 and 36 inches above the top of the dining table. This range assumes you have an 8-foot ceiling."

The belt goes down to the table and when sharpening big tools you must use caution. This product does not have a good way of holding the correct angle on the tool when sharpening tools so you will need to free hand it if you don't need a perfect angle.",

There are three holes and 4 on the center which make this a laundry sink. On the top ledge the faucet goes there with a \"soap\" holder on each side of the faucet. As far as the unit itself, there is no reason it can't be used outside. The legs are not very strong but depending on where in the U.S. you live, there shouldn't be a problem."

      "These motion detector lights will be triggered whenever a person, vehicle or other objects pass by. Many varieties are sensitive enough that even small animals can trigger them. These lights are designed to go off 30 to 60 seconds after movement has ceased. These lights only switch on during the chosen hours and when there's movement. Be aware that the brightness outside can affect this. An incandescent 60-watt bulb, for example, gives off 800 lumens of light. And LED bulbs, which are more energy efficient than their incandescent counterparts, can deliver the same amount of light using as little as 10 watts. Passive infrared (PIR) sensors use a pair of pyroelectric sensors to detect heat energy in the surrounding environment. These two sensors sit beside each other, and when the signal differential between the two sensors changes (if a person enters the room, for example), the sensor will engage."

      "The type of insulation normally used for pex pipes is foam simply because it can be flexible and seems to work well with pex tubing. Before you wrap the pipes in foam make sure to clean it with a wet rag. If your water supply piping is plastic, only use automatic thermostatically controlled heat tape. Non-automatic heat tapes can damage plastic pipes, especially if the taped pipes are covered with insulation."

The low beam would conserve battery life while certainly allowing plenty of light for finding one's way through the dark.  During moments of greater need, the high beam can be quickly accessed and will provide a blinding beam of light.  Again, being able to limit the use of high beam to moments of real need, you will extend the life of your batteries.",

This is a very powerful light and will get hot to the touch during extended use of the product. The batteries for this product could be a strange size and may also be fairly expensive to buy. The Mag-Tac does not offer a lockout option, however, the Maglite XL200 does offer this feature. IT is also worth noting that the 18650 is a bit thicker than the Mag-Tac."

If you want to get your element close to the bottom of your pot you will run into a problem when screwing . the ripple element requires a good clearance with the bottom to avoid contact. I recomment to you to take a look at brewharware.com. they have tri clover ferrule with electrical enclosure for these elements. They also have welding spud ferrule that can be silver solder. Just got two of those tri clover element kits and i juste love them. If you still want to solder a coupler you will need a 1\"  NPSL thread. Good luck.",

      "This product can be fitted into a pot with a 1.5\" tri-clover fitting via a 1.5 tri-clamp to 1\" threaded connector. Thus, a 2\" tri-clover fitting isn't needed. This product fits with a 1\"NPS nut rather than a 1 1 and 3/8 inch thread. It is approximately 1/2\" long if the washer is removed. Adjusting the element to a different power level, either lower voltage needs to be supplied 120V instead or 240V or if the element must be driven using a controller of either PWM style (50% power would be to turn the element on for 50% of the time, then off for 50% of the time, but switch really quickly) or phase angle control style. There are heating elements that are sold by a few companies online and instructions on the self-building controllers can be found on forums. Refer to http://www.brewhardware.com/rimsherms-parts-93 to obtain an SS half coupling for welding to a pot for this element. The recommended website sells a tri-clover flange with a CNC cut radius that can be solver soldered, and other parts if a different route is desired. With a 220-240V/30amp power supply, with a starting point around 140-160F from the sparge under brewing conditions, the time taken to get up to 212F for 13 gallons of water should be about 30mins. This can be operated at 110V, 1375W will be produced and 12.5A will be drawn. 1/4 of your power is lost from 240V to 110V. This is Canadian listed. Lack of information is provided to determine if it is listed the same as being CE-marked European use. Refer to http://www.camco.net/assets/catalog/Hardware_2013.pdf."

They use a piston mechanism instead of a special clutch enabling them to deliver a much more powerful hammer blow than traditional Hammer Drills - they are able to drill larger holes much faster. The smallest chipping hammers, powered electrically, pneumatically, or hydraulically, usually weight between 5 and 30 pounds. As usual, a good indication of the power of the tools is their weight.

      "A sheepsfoot blade has a straight cutting edge and an unsharpened curved back spine that curves down to meet the straight edge and it makes a false point. This can used for cutting and slicing where a point is not wanted or needed. Pi, a never-ending string of numbers, is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. This ratio stays the same no matter how big or small it is. For ease of use, pi is commonly shortened to 3.14. The diameter of the circle is 6.37 centimeters. These are usually made entirely of cylindrical or hexagonal forged steel with a diameter of approximately 1 in (2.5 cm). Chisel and wedge ends have a blade and the width measures about  1 to 3 in (3 to 8 cm). Using a wheelbarrow, you can move woods from stacks to pile on the back porch. Using a cloth carrier you can move wood into the house as it will catch most of the debris that will keep the floor clean. Use a ballpen or masonry hammer and cold chisel to tap the pieces free and make sure to always wear safety glass when removing ceramic tiles. In some cases, The only way to remove a ceramic tile is with the use of heavy equipment such as a jackhammer or air chisel. If your knife is very dull or has a nicked blade, start with your coarsest stone. This stone will remove material quickly so a poor edges can be refined. However, the coarse stone must be followed up with your finer stone to refine the edge. Zombies are afraid of fire, so you will definitely want some fireworks with you. Incendiary grenades, smoke grenades, and termites all sound like a great idea. They will produce lots of bang and fizzle, which will allow you to escape. The best time to transplant mums is after they have finished blooming, generally in the late fall or even the middle of winter. Prune chrysanthemums back to the greenery once they turn brown. You can refer to the free video for advice coming from a sustainable gardener."

      "If the low water pressure seems restricted to a single faucet or showerhead, the problem isn't with your pipes or water supply, but with the fixture itself. If it's a sink, the most common causes are a clogged aerator or clogged cartridge. If the trigger of the sink sprayer is stuck on, work a flat-head screwdriver under the handle of the spray nozzle and push down on the spray button to stop the nozzle from spraying. Brushed chrome has a blueish hue and is less shiny than polished chrome. Chrome itself is commonly plated onto another metal such as copper or nickel to provide a little extra hardness and resistance, as well as a shiny finish. Although you can't completely keep your faucet from spotting unless you install a water softener, by cleaning the faucet regularly you can prevent deposits from building up, so the chrome looks its best at all times."

      "This product is translucent or opaque glass, often milky white, made by adding impurities such as fluorine compounds to the melt. It appears white by reflected light but shows color images through thin sections. It is used for ornamental glass and as an efficient light diffuser. Ceiling light fixtures should always hang dead-center on the most important architecture of the room. Whenever possible, ceiling lighting should also be centered on windows and doors that are architecturally-significant. A surface mounted light sits on top of a flat surface like the flat part of a ceiling and protrudes away from the surface.

      "There are six sanding belts with three grits plus sharpening guides for knives and other cutting tools. using the coarse belt and the scissor guide, you can create a good edge appropriate for cutting brush and under growth. It is similar to sharpening with a leather strop. You can easily hold you blade at a lower angle to get the 17 dgrees (or whatever) angle you want for your razor. You only need to pull a knife through for less than 3 to 5 seconds per side. When the angle has been achieved it only takes one or two swipes to keep the blades sharp once they are dull. A convex grind is stronger than a flat grind (stone) or hollow grind (wheel) and will stay sharper longer."

You must use oil or cutting fluid as the bits will overheat and dull very quick. This product will wear out on metal and works best on wood according to the manufacturer. The pilot point feature is really helpful in avoiding decentering when first starting your hole. This product can be use carbide bits on rock, concrete, masonry, metal, etc."

However, the remotes need to be very close to the light and pointed directly at it to work.  Therefore, unless the lights are RIGHT next to each other, you can change one light to one color, then move to the next light and change it to a different color.  I do this for holidays and will do the same for Christmas.  I.E. - One light red, one light green, next one red, etc.",

The arm does swivel so the light can be shifted from straight down on your work surface to up on a wall, but I haven't found that swivel to be helpful.  The light emitted is very good, easy on the eyes.  But there is relatively little flexibility to adjusting the angle of the light down onto the surface below, or the height of the light.",

      "If you're looking to light a very large room, upwards-facing lights will be more effective for diffusing light further, whereas downwards-facing lights would be sufficient if you're only lighting a small space. This product would, however, also be subject to the primary use of the room. The correct height of the table lamp is typically determined by the seating piece and the height of the table beside it. The table lamp should be tall enough for the bottom of the lampshade to come to the eye level of the person seated beside it. Full-size fluorescent lamps are available in several shapes, including straight, U-shaped, and circular configurations. Lamp diameters range from 1\" to 2.5\". The most common lamp type is the four-foot (F40), 1.5\" diameter (also called T12) straight fluorescent lamp. The temperature of this metal is measured in degrees Kelvin. CRI is a measurement of a light source's accuracy in rendering different colors when compared to a reference light source with the same correlated color temperature. There are three primary types of voltage transformers (VT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic voltage transformer is a wire-wound transformer. To determine power in Watts, simply multiply Volts times the current in Amps. The 60 Hz doesn't matter. For a 120 volt outlet with nothing plugged in or whatever plugged in being off, the amps and therefore watts of the circuit is zero."

        "answer": "Yes, the Zoeller M53 is an outdoor pump, as it is waterproof electrically. In my application, the pump normally rests in water just above the impeller casting and turns on when the water gets to be 2/3 of the water-pump housing via the float. The pump sits in a basin that is two feet down into the earth.  Consider Monnit sensors to tell you when the pump turns on, so you know it is operational. Google Monnit. If running underground conduit for electrical power to the pump, ensure compliance with your local city codes.  Hope this helps.",

      "This product has a three standard prong outlet. It's  16 gauge and shoots from 1 inch to 2 1/2 inch nails. This item does have two outputs for two different tools at once and is oil-free. This works great for small gauge fasteners such as staple guns and finish nailers. Not recommended for screw guns or air hammers.  This item will do a good job for you, but you need something larger for a big job that will take say 2 to 3 hours none stop. used for the first time for at least 30 seconds. Maintains pressure for weeks when not in use. CHINA like KEITH is both easy to use and do a good job. It's a good buy and a great item.",

There have been times when I thought it did, and then lots of times where it failed the test.  too weird,  the butt end has enough to pull a screw across the table, so it does hold itself in the screwdriver, which it doesn't need, it's anchored very well.   The working tip that would hold the screw in place also has it but it's so weak it's just about worthless.  every once in a while it kinda seemed to attract the screw, but not really, I'd consider it pointless.hope that helps.  still a great tool, yeah, I wish it had a stronger tip magnet.",

Milwaukee 44 in/lbs, big dewalt 80 in/lbs . Hitachi website states, Max Torque 44 in/lbs. It doesn't even weigh a pound but they're probably referring to shipping weight which includes the carrying case, 2 batteries and the charger with the driver. The driver alone with a battery and bit installed is a pound or less. This item accepts the standard size for electric screwdrivers,  you can use it to remove stripped metal screws about 2 and a half inches long. There is a small button to activate the LED light when needed. It's located on the grip near the top. Hope that helps. It comes with a hard case, a charger, 2 batteries, and a Phillips bit and the charger has a sticker made in China.",

Just find a stud or nailer and put the foldout tab on that point an the tip of the gun is at the next 16\" position. This gun is incredible................. over 10,000 shots and no hangs or misfires. My old FN60 is a Dinosaur in comparison.",

The base of the lamp is good and only the lightbulb shades need to be put in place. The Assembly of this lamp is extremely easy. If you are looking for a reading light, you might want something that can be angled down toward your book. If you have small children, you may want to secure it to prevent them from pulling it down."

The imprint on the cable reads that it is 12 gauge, and a small bit of the wire that's visible in the translucent connector appears to be 12 gauge. Using it with heavy power tools, there is almost no current lag at startup. So, I'd say it's plenty safe to assume it is 12 gauge.",

The DCB200 is 3.0 AMPs per hour and the DCB204 is 4.0 Amps per hour. The Black & Decker Battery is designed differently and is not likely to be compatible with this DeWalt product.

It can adequately charge 4 18650 batteries, but it can charge AA and AAA at the same time up to 4 at once. Check out this charger. It's the one I use now of the several I have.

      "This product is a Super Bright 3X CREE XM-L T6 LED Torch 4000Lm flashlight. The batteries cannot be charged inside this flashlight. You will need to purchase a charger such as the Nitecore IntelliCharger i4 to charge 4 18650s at once. If you hold the power button on it changes to a rapid flash. This light works with 1 to 4 batteries. You get the longest run time with 4 batteries but if you only have one charged, you still have a light. there is a wrist rope to hold it around your wrist instead of holding it in your hand. It will work well with one battery. Four x 18650 cells may last 5 hours in low."

        "answer": "Not really sure.  It weighs only 1.25 lbs. and is a little more than 19 inches long.  When swinging it, it feels quite solid.  I think aluminum would be lighter and not feel as substantial, though they could have come more weighty material placed inside.  It is a formidable weapon...has the charge at the end and also about 6 inches of spiked surface just below the end.  Fortunately I haven't had to use it yet, but it does give me a measure of security hanging next to my bed.  I hope this helps...",
