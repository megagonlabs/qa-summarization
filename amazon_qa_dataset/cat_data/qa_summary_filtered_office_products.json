The doors also have four permanent shelves. This product is a paper laminate with plenty of room for VHS tapes to fit on the shelves and inside the doors. This product doesn't have large enough shelves to fit records inside. You aren't required to install the lock but if you choose to forego it, there will be a small hole near the top. It is also a choice to install the lock and not use it."

That is, it does not have any kind of apparatus or tray (like on a fax machine) that would allow you to load say a large number of pieces to be shredded, and have either gravity or a roller (like what they have in small printers) pull the product down into the shredder.  You can continuously feed pieces to be shredded, one at a time, manually into the shredder and it will handle that.   Hope that helps.  Overall, it is a very good shredder and very quiet.",

You can't dial another number e. g., call a second party from a second handset while someone is talking on the first handset to the original party.  You would have to have two separate telephone lines with two separate base telephone units - one connected to each of the two separate lines - in order to conduct two independent conversations at the same time.

From everything I read, and encountered on my own attempts, I feel it is probably the only way to have it programmed.  Do not expect it to work right from the box.

      "This product comes with a basic indoor antenna and is detachable and has a twist BNC design. This scanner has an ohm cable input and can receive both analog and digital signals.  The BCD996XT doesn't require a computer but it's easier and faster to do programming on a computer and then upload it to a scanner rather than using a keypad to enter data. This product does not need a USB interface cable and can receive both analog and digital signals. There was a beta version of a Uniden compatible programming tool for Mac OS that never got off the ground. It never made it out of Beta. Buy a software that has the Home Patrol feature where the databases are preloaded into the scanner and put your zip code in."

The bean bag lap design is the only comfortable part of this lapdesk. I think the lapdesk should come with a removable bean cushion for the hard frame, so the user's hands and wrists can rest more comfortably during use.I hope this helped.Lydia",

But one of the best features of this device is that it works very well without being plugged into a computer at all. The images are stored on an SD card (or micro SD card with an adaptor like the one in the box). You can then transfer them to a computer simply by plugging the SD card into your laptop (mist computers have a built in card reader anyway). Very very easy. Images may need tweaking but otherwise great. Results from 35mm negatives were especially pleasing.",

You can enter names for each handset so that when you want to intercom, you can choose (for ex) \"basement\" or \"garage\" as opposed to a number. Each phone/handset has its own charger and the base unit will be wall mounted. There are not any batteries in the base unit.  The handsets each use 2 AAA rechargeable batteries (included).  The batteries are Ni-MH so they don't have the \"memory effect\" that Lithium batteries have. This phone has a headset jack which is on each extension phone on the left side under the volume button."

The printer will accommodate plain stock 8.5 x 11, legal paper 8.5 x 14, and photo paper 4 x 6. The paper tray has a special holder for 4x6 photo paper and 8.5x11 paper, and will print two sided copy. Both sides of a page cannot be faxed at the same time. 2400 dpi is the highest quality of scanner as it has the highest number of pixels. Directions can be found on the manufacturer website. There may be compatibility problems with Macs. Keep in mind that the stark ink cartridges are small and may need to be replaced after a short amount of time."

      "This printer cannot be used as a scanner without an ink cartridge installed or if the cartridge is empty. This printer can be used to scan to PDF. Control Center 4 software comes provided with the printer. The scanner on this product scans at 11x17, which is ideal for posters. This printer cannot scan two-sided documents in one pass. Only one side can be scanned at a time. Software is provided to combine both scans into one document. This printer doesn't come with an 11x17 tray, only a standard one. This printer goes into normal print quality by default to save ink. Printer quality can be changed in print options to 'best' so that the print quality of images is not blurred. The fax on this printer works well and will give you the option to print it or not. It also has a distinctive ring tone if connected to a phone line. It can also be used with wi-fi. This printer accepts wireless connections as well as ethernet and USB connections. Ethernet provides the best performance. A USB cable is not provided with this product."

The back has a slight slope. If the bottom is flush against the wall, the top will be about 1 1/2 - 2\" from the wall. This item has approximately 1 inch round rubber non-slip pads on the bottom of the legs which makes this stool very balanced, rigid, and doesn't wobble at all. The stool is sturdy and works well for getting into large vehicles, mounting horses or for people with a hip problems, however fold up is not possible as it's one solid piece."

You will lose some height and will want to put rubber boots on the legs to keep them from scratching the floor. This item would fit a KitchenAid stand mixer on the bottom shelf. The shelves of this item are adjustable in 1\" increments. The top shelf of this item can be lowered.  It won't affect the handle. It can't be on the same level as the handle.

      "This printer's cartridges is mega-expensive which indicates that is has wireless capability. It's a great little printer, that comes with a full set of toner.  It handles card stock and glossy card stock. The duplex doesn't have the option for  \"DN\" and \"N\" modes. The 500 prints 1200dpi so if you have the depth of field and your software can handle, printing on a Letter size paper. The 507X contains twice as much ink but is an after market purchase, which cartridge is 507a. AC100v-240v 50/60HZ, this voltage works for the device according to the installation manual.

You just need to see if they print black and white separately. Some printers will mix all colors to make black and white printouts, others have a dedicated black and white cartridge or drum. It is more ideal to have a separate unit for black and white as mixing the colors to make black and white eats the levels of ink or toner very quickly. I hope that makes sense.- Damon",
