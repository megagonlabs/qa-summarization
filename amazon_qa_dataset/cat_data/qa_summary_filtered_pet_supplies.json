It doesn't tip over in the wind as long as it is well anchored and the birdbath is well anchored, however, the wind can blow the dripper so it is twists off center and ends up dripping on the rim of the birdbath. Mine isn't in a really windy area but I still readjust it daily. The birds love it and I love the birds, so worth it to me.",
