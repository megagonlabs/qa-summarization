The item's minimum height adjustment is about 18 3/4 inches from the floor to the top of the seat. The seat's maximum height adjustment is twenty-one inches. Each leg is adjustable. If needed, the legs are removable, and the aluminum frame can be cut to bring the chair lower. The inner framing is slightly smaller, so purchasing protective rubber feet may be necessary to avoid damage to the tub. The seat is resistant to rust. It also has large pads that make it resistant to slipping, and it is light enough to be moved around by most people. The seat is intended for walk-in showers. Fits inside of tubs may vary. A tub inside width must be at least 16 1/2\" to fit the chair. The seat cannot face faucets in tubs and must be used sideways to fit in a bathtub."

There are two speeds to pick from so you should find one of them satisfactory.  A certain amount of \"vibration\" and pressure is required to adequately clean your teeth, of course.  I've found it to do a much better job then a manual toothbrush.",

The brush head spins clockwise and and anti clock wise.  You get more control on the area you want to brush. This might be helpful to sensitive gums. The Oral B 4000 toothbrush has 4 stages of cleaning - daily use, sensitivity, whitening and deep cleaning.  A push of a button changes the mode. All modes light up except the deep cleaning. The product tells you if you brush too hard. It also beeps and may shut down. The product stays pretty clean after a year. Braun is a German company, so most products are manufactured there or under license in the US."

When product is in your mouth, wait for 3 minutes for product to harden after applying mixture. Use a denture adhesive like Fixodent on top of the liner to hold.

It is also able to help heal a leaky gut. This is due to product having high amounts of glutamine, which is essential for the health of the gut. Note that it does not help hair growth as it is a protein supplement. The product's efficiency depends entirely on the person. These types of products come with different food based on the label. Red labels come with beef, orange labels come with pork, and green labels come with beef. It is best stored in a dry place, which can give it an indefinite shelf life."

        "answer": "It has an auto power off of only 5 or 10 minutes to conserve power. Bluetooth itself uses little power. I've not charged it and gotten weeks of daily use. Charging usually only takes me an hour or so but uses a standard charger for most android phones. You can charge it nearly anywhere with a cable and power block.",

Similarly, I haven't really kept track of how long it takes to charge, as I usually just plug it in and leave it overnight, but I can't imagine it takes longer than a couple hours to fully charge? Maybe someone can provide some more exact answers, but hopefully this helps a bit. By the way, this thing is awesome. Highly recommended.",

      "This cast cover stays on by adjusting the fit. This is done by cutting the end and using the attached bulb to pump the air, sealing it on your arm. The cast cover can be used with an air cast if the tightness is not an issue.  If the air cast has screws or something similar, it may tear when taking on or off. The cast does not have a draw string at the top. There is a rubber seal which gets tighter when you use the bulb for sucking out the air which creates a vacuum seal underneath the mitt. The cast cover can be used in public swimming baths but you should check that it does not leak. You may need to tape the top of the cover. The measuring directions listed are accurate and the cast will fit an overweight male who is 5 feet 8 inches tall. This cover can be used in the ocean but should be rinsed with fresh water after use. The cast cover will work properly on unshaven legs. For the casts that are close to the knees one should get the full leg cover.  In order to create a good seal without water getting in, you need about 2 inches from the bottom of the knee."

I bought this for personal use and always use the liners.  The liners are not thick enough plastic to hinder the vibration from reaching your feet.  I do agree that the vibration on this model is mild.  I would recommend if you want stronger vibration for your feet, the Hitachi Magic Wand Back Massager is very strong and does the trick on sore feet and calves.   Hope this helps you!",

        "answer": "No.  The seat can fold down but basically it remains in one piece.  I built a ramp and can put it into a Toyota Sienna if the middle seats are removed.  It is also bumpy to ride: no springs or shock absorbers.  To get any shock absorption you will have to pay more.  It is still running well for me after several years but I am thinking of the \"Heartway Vita Monster\".  It costs about $5000 and is much larger and faster (12 mph).  Hope this helps. Lawrence",

      "This product can be used as an ultrasonic humidifier and produces a fine mist over a few hours. It makes rapid, tiny oscillations that agitate the vapor to make a fine mist. Heat is not involved. This product has an electric cord and does not run on batteries. The light on this product can be turned off. The switch is separate from the mist. This product is easy to clean by using a paper towel on the inside. There is not a separate well for the essential oils, but you can put water in as needed then put in the essential oil. This product can use the light without the humidifier. However, this product mixes with water to create a light scent like a humidifier would. It doesn't create enough steam or humidity to add moisture to the room. This product can run for about four hours and must have the timer on to run."

We like it, very useful. It can be set to vibrate or beep--we use the beeper. It does hold most big pills but not too many at once, we have a mixture of large and small and it works well.

It has two alarms which can be turned off by pressing the round button in the center. You can program the alarm to the desired time. It has a strong vibration and the alarm is loud so you will always be alerted at the time to which you set it.  the dimensions are 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches, meaning it will fit comfortably in a pocket or purse."

She then discovered the walls not only turned out looking grainy but the noticable scratches ruined the glossy shine. No Handy play it safe : do not use this scrubber if your bathroom has manufactured marble. This product is safe for porceline and non-cultured marble. I have noncultured marble in my bathroom and so far the scrubber works and cleans efficiently. Thanks for contacting me :)",

      "This pad will scratch gel-coated marble because it is abrasive. The Casabella Flex Neck is good for cleaning bathtubs and old-fashioned porcelain wall tile. Search for these in the Sponge Mop section. This pad works on the curves between the walls and the curved bottom of the tub but must be pressed hard to get it to bend when new. It will be much more flexible with regular use. Extra sponges are unavailable with this package but can be purchased on Amazon. The sponge attaches to the holder easily with Velcro-like backing. The holder attaches to the pole via a flexible rubber neck and it is durable. This scrubber is safe for the acrylic enclosed bath fitter, with no bending required. This product can also be used in a fully hones marble shower or on polished marble, as it is able to clean tile and grout well with no scratches. It is not recommended for use on fiberglass, as fiberglass should be cleaned with a non abrasive microfiber cloth."

It bulks your stool and when you go it will be one long piece like a proper passing of stool should be. I can't say it causes more regularity because that wasn't my problem. Hope that helps. Just try it. You get a ton of it cheap. Another reason I won't use anything else and I'm super picky when it comes to supplements. I box, bike, weightlift and do boot camp classes.",

This product has a frame of painted black metal that is very sturdy. It is easy to assemble and is stable. This product has an adjustable headrest that tilts and is parallel to the floor. This product can be used for children or people who are 4'10 without a problem. This product has a face opening that is wide enough to read through and is comfortable enough to sit in but it hasn't been tested for more than an hour at a time. You can adjust the height of this product easily for different clients by turning the knob and sliding some other connected parts. This product will work for someone who is 6 feet tall."

So, Remington is trying to \"cash in\" on this little jewel.  It is bad enough you cannot find it in stores anymore, but now, Remington is screwing its customers with this ridiculous price increase.  Once again, Corporate America lives up to its reputation.",

      "This product operates both corded and cordless when the battery is charged which is very handy. This product can work in Europe with 110 to 240 volts but may require a travel adapter if you plan to use it in Germany, UK, France, etc so that it will adapt to the US style plug. The pop-up trimmer needs to be manually pushed down to get put away once opened. This product is not waterproof and isn't to be used with shaving cream or wet shaving products. The older model DA307 is better quality than the newer one. The newer razor is more quiet but doesn't shave as well as the older model 390 even though the 390 and 370 are the same and the only difference is the color."

      "The Shower Bench Seat with Shelf comes assembled and is sturdy enough for 325 to 180 pounds. To add the legs on you take a few Hex bolts and bolt the legs on. The height is about 18-24 inches and can accommodate the slope in your shower because it is adjustable. To compensate for the slope you can use felts or rubber squares. The screws seem to rust and the bench can be affected by water which means don't leave anything metal on it."

This heating pad can be used without inflating it; however, the heating pad self-inflates when you open the valve and will stay inflated. A better solution might be to use a regular Sunbeam with a small pillow. This heating pad does not come with a car adapter. The pad does not cut off automatically, but another Sunbeam blanket does."
