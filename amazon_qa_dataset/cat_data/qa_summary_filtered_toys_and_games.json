      "This product is a durable helicopter that is appropriate for 5-7 year olds. 5 of these can fly at the same time because each radio \"binds\" to each receiver inside the helicopter and no frequencies are the same. To get the receiver and the transmitter to sync together you must place the copter on a flat level surface and ensure that the controller throttle stick is at the absolute bottom of the dance for the throttle. Once the unit binds and the light stops flashing and a beep is head there is a successful connection. Each battery will last 5 to 7 minutes and requires 10 to 15 minutes to charge. The product can fly outside but practice is advised as it can be more touchy due to wind. The heli has one red led light for flying and the new version of this heli can only accept the new version of the batteries."

There are no decals or stickers for decoration. The bed is 18' in length and can fit a Cabbage Patch doll or an American Girl Doll well. The clearance allows an AG doll to easily fit into the bottom bed and the quality is worth the price. The beds are not attached and can be adjusted on top of each other to make two twins of the same height. They fit together through pegs. The beds stay together with the pegs when stacked. The construction process is easy enough for a child to put together. The bed is sturdy and will not fall, and the ladder rests to the side of the bed."

This product will work with an ECX torment but it's heavy and will cause it to move slower. It won't fit a hpi blitz due to the holes mounting incorrectly. Note that the cage won't fit a Ford Raptor replica. The plastic body will fit over the cage but small adjustments may be needed.

      "The DX7s 7-Ch Radio system comes with a charger that plugs right into the radio. You need a receiver to make sure the AR8000 receiver is compatible with your toy. There are many items included such as a 128 MB SD Card, a 12V DC power supply, a hex wrench and more. The DX7 doesn't offer a wireless trainer option, but it's a great transmitter overall. The DX7s 7-CH doesn't need a charger as it runs on AA batteries.  Servos aren't included as it's a TX and RX package only."

There is no brake, but there is one button on the right handlebar that you need to press down to move  and release if you want it to stop. The vehicle should not travel fast enough to require a break. The battery is indeed the big blue one. The battery will need about one hour to charge, and it will hold the charge for around 4 to 5 hours.",

Everything included comes wrapped separately but fits in the case. The black trays do not have clear lids on them, they just hold the tiles. The tiles can fall out if the trays are turned over. The bam tiles are green, and the dots are black and red. It will not be confusing and is a nice set for a beginner."

The 1/100th  means it is to scale of the actual size of the \"real gundam\". The instructions are in Japanese, but there are clear images to show you how to assemble the parts. English translated instructions can be found. The kit comes with a variety of different hands. This model height is about 8 inches. You use a stand that can be taller and/or wider. The only tool needed for assembly is model clippers. It is the same size as most master grade kits. This is a redesign of the original manga/anime design. The original has a mini-gun but the big difference is the shield."

    "summary": [
      "The product is set in ancient times but there's nothing like magic or supernatural premises included with the game. While the product does have some history about the 7 wonders, it's not considered educational. The game uses the seven wonders of the ancient world. They are the Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Garden of Babylon, Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. This is an interactive play where men and women are dressed appropriately and an average of 8 to 10  will be fine playing this game. The game takes around 30 minutes depending on who you are playing with and how will it take to make choices. You may be able to tally the scores at the end of your head if you wish since its not necessary to write in the game. For this product, you may want to try these ideal sleeves for the cards by Ultra Pro at (http://amzn.com/B005CM80X0). Mayday sleeves are much thinner, stick to one another, and split easily when shuffling while you won't experience these issues with Ultra Pro. The downside of  Ultra Pro is that the cards don't fit perfectly and it can be a bit tight. The game's instructions can be downloaded at  http://rprod.com/index.php?. There is a video on youtube if you want an outside source, it is entitled \"7 Wonders Demo - BoardGameGeek Booth - Essen Spiel 2010.\" It will help you understand the rules of the game better."

The food pans however, would likely have to be replaced, as they take something of a beating during use and service.",

I dont know if it breaks easy though. I wrote absolutely stuning because of the paint and looks. If you dont find an answer, ask the other reviewers, i hope this helps, even if its a little bit. If you still dont find an answer, ill be ordering it but not until the end of the month. Maybe try looking up the figure on youtube. Watch a couple of reviews, just so you can build your confidence on this figure.",

It takes a couple hours to charge the fully dead three cell battery and I have two of them. You can charge through the 120 outlets plugin or right off of a car battery too with the connector that comes with the boat. I hope this helps anyone who wants to try this boat out for fast fun. BTW it does tip itself back over when it flips over in the water. Look for the youtube videos made for this boat.",

        "answer": "With a 3S 11.1 volt LiPo battery pack fully charged and broken in, you should get 8 to 10 minutes run time.  As for the time it takes to charge the battery, it depends on what type of charger you are using.  If you are using the peak charger that is included with the Barbwire boat, your charge time will be about an hour.  Hope the information is helpful.",

The item comes on its own and will need plain wood clothes pins for the wings and body and painting them depends on the skills of the users. The toy is not fit for a 12 year old as it is far too detailed. The airplane's wingspan is about 26\" wide and 18\" long.  It's about the same size as the B24 Liberator but much smaller than the B29. The airplane is motionless and takes time and patience to assemble."

In the packet there are about a thousand little beads and They expand  7 times their size. They take up a lot of space and I had to use the biggest container we have to store them.

They do become kind of fragile. You can play with them, just let them flow through your fingers and pick them up and look at them... they are pretty. But if you pick them up with your fingers and squish them too hard, they will break and kind of disintegrate. I think they would last as long as you allow them to. Hope this helps!!",

The numbering on this board is electronic and red which makes it very easy to read. This product has three different levels of heckling available and some are funny while others are bothersome. This item doesn't come assembled in arcade style and is time consuming to put together. This product is regulation when placed on a hard floor and can be a bit off if placed on soft floors like carpet."
