Fs2004 is a type of plane and you can get numerous alternatives from the FSX and get NGX. This item is incompatible with  the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 but however you can search online and download service pack 2 upgrade. You can use the serial number on the box to download updates for  PMDG 737 NGX. It is difficult to obtain updates if the product is a cracked version.  The product's base package is 800/900 and the 600/700 add on and is bought separately from the base package but you can consider the FS2004 that comes with complete 4 series of packages. The default item may lack livereries but you can refer to the official website  (PMDG.COM) for livereries."

      "This is an over-the-ear headset that is amazingly comfortable. The sound quality is good and close in quality to the Turtle Beach brand. The headset only produces stereo and does not have surround sound. They are particularly good for the price, though they are not as loud as other brands. The wonderful thing about this headset is that it has a standard headphone jack, and it just plugs into your controller with no extra batteries needed. The headset plugs directly into the game controller and uses the same signal, giving you the option to use as many different headsets as you have controllers. You will only need to set up the headset the first time you use it, however, you might need to update your controller with the adapter connected. The product does not come with a mic monitor and you cannot hear yourself thru the mic when you speak."

The game is in English but the Japanese audio can be downloaded through the Playstation Network. The voices are in English in the North American version. Branch A is the main branch of the game. To unlock Branch D you have to do the Lost Verses and get all the weapons. If you loved the characters and story of Nier, you will love Drakengard 3. Drakengards story isn't as good but it's very interesting. You can only buy DLC to get Japanese voice and English subtitle support."

If you are new to the game and you want to play from start to finish it will take 16 to 20 hours. This game is actually way faster and you use the game pad to navigate so way easier than the GameCube versionCx however the game is single player. If you are a solo player get zelda.  If you like to play with friends get smash.  Although a very good game, zelda has low replay value compared to smash."

      "If you bought FSX Gold Edition which includes FSX Deluxe and FSX Acceleration, the SP1 and SP2 are included in the Acceleration DVD. If you bought FSX Acceleration separately, it includes SP1 and SP1 on the DVD. The Acceleration Pack is a multiplayer-based expansion for FSX which also included the F/A-18A Hornet, EH-101 helicopter and the P-51D Mustang. Let the player use an engine if the connected fuel tank is empty. Using this mode requires the player to have the Expansion Bundle. You can run both 32bit and 64bit programs on a 64bit OS, but you cannot run 64bit programs on a 32bit OS. Some hardware only allows for 32bit OSs. This tends to be related to the CPU more than anything else. Windows 8.1 will be supported until 2023. It is safe to use Windows 8.1 until 2023, after which the support would end and you would have to update to the next version to keep on receiving security and other updates. Windows 7 can still be installed and activated after end of support. However, it will be more vulnerable to security risks and viruses due to the lack of security updates."
