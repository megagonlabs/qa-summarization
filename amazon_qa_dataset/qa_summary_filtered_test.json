Just a suggestion, tho: I'd really recommend that you use an LED bulb for this lamp since it doesn't heat up. Also, using a 100W equivalent CFL worked best for me in terms of lighting (that is, if you want your light to be bright but also very relaxing for the eyes) and this bulb, specifically, is really durable and energy efficient.

      "Virtually all PCs and monitors use the standard 'kettle' lead connector for power. Typically you'll need two power cables, one for the PC and one for the monitor. Some monitors, however, have an external power supply, so you won't plug the kettle lead directly into the monitor. The mic stand is compatible with all microphones. Put something that can absorb sound underneath the keyboard, like a thin foam mat. Sound travels along multiple paths, including some that reflect up to a microphone from a hard desk surface. The Shure SM57 is one of the most widely used mics for guitar amps, but some other favorites include Sennheiser's e609 Silver, e906, and MD 421 II; Audix's i5; Royer's R-121; Telefunken's M81; and the Neumann U 47 fet. Choosing the best universal microphone shock mount is interesting because most microphone brands offer their own compatible shock mounts that are designed to perfectly fit the microphone they are designed for. In some cases, they don't offer a compatible shock mount, which is a great reason to get a universal one. Phantom power, commonly designated as +48V or P48, was designed to power microphones without using bulky external power supplies such as the ones required for tube microphones. It's most widely used as a power source for condenser microphones, which have active electronics. Be sure to verify whether your microphone is a condenser type or another type such as dynamic or ribbon.

      "This product contains multiple sheet labels and can fit most 3-ring binders.  Since the standard size of loose-leaf paper is 8.5 inches by 11 inches, most 3-ring binders are about 10 inches wide and 12 inches tall. You can choose from a wide selection of 1/2\" binders with different types of rings. Use your own photos or designs to create a custom divider. You can use Avery 8 tab binder dividers which are easy to print and apply clear to a label strip or index maker so you can print many on one page. Dividers are used for scribing circles, arcs and for transferring and stepping off distances."

If the filter cannot be removed, clean it out with brush. Some filters are disposable, so instead of cleaning them you can just throw them away and put a new one in place. Wipe down the interior, exterior and lid of the DeLonghi deep fat fryer with a slightly damp, soapy sponge. Avoid getting any moisture on the area where the plug attaches to the fryer. Wring out the sponge and saturate it with soap several times to clean away all the oil residue."

I use an Olympus E-PL1 with a VF-2 viewfinder, so my hot-shoe is being taken up by the viewfinder.  Using this bracket, I can use my VF2 and an External Flash, I've also found that the grip on the side (which is a sturdy foam) give a bit more control and less shake to my camera.  Their are multiple screw mount points on the bottom of the Bracket, I would imagine that it would fit most cameras.",

It also helps prevent red eye and blinking.  Another advantage is that it maintains a better point of light while slowing the camera to rotate from horizontal to vertical.  Hope this helps.",

You could also  turn the flash to sideways with the rotating bracket. Comes handy if you do not have walls or reflectors to bounce light. If you add a soft box for your flash, you would a much nicer tone especially if you are shooting people -- the pictures come out definitely better. The grip too lends a hand in handling your kit.",

      "This flash flip bracket will fit almost any SLR and flash with a standard hot shoe, including the Nikon D3100 with the Nikon SB 700 flash. An additional extension cord is needed to synchronize the flash with the camera. This bracket's structural pieces are made of metal and foam. The hot shoe is made of metal. To attach the external flash extension cord, insert one end into the camera and the other end into the cold shoe where the flash sits. The purpose of the Flash Bracket is to prevent red eye by positioning the light above eye level.  Professional photographers do this using a detachable light held at arms length from above. The result is more natural because the light is coming from a slight angle.  This bracket achieves this effect. The flash holder has a thumb screw located on the bottom to keep it attached to the bracket."

Right over our lawn, we have a large \"Greenstead Conifer\" which drops heaps of pine needles and small conifer nuts.

Therefore it is easy to pour the exact amount of drops you desire for various health/beauty treatment.

The nail heads are a bit small, but if you dial the regulated pressure on your compressor down to 50 psi or so, AND you drive the nails at an angle, they will consistently lay into the vinyl grooves with room for wiggle. (the head fits perfectly for nail placement) This speeds up putting up siding like nobody's business!",

The coil siding nailer can be purchased at a number of online retailers but the nails are really hard to get. The depth adjustment is a dial just below the trigger on the N66C. You must make sure you use Bostitch brand nails with this product. This product would not be good for vinyl siding  because you should use a hand nailer so the nails are not as tight."

I'm sure you could cook items for canning in the bottom pot itself if not cooking a large amount at the time. The pot is large enough for doing a 10 min boiling bath on jelly jars if you wanted. Not pints or quarts. I also plan to use the steamer to steam my squash and okra for freezing this summer. It is an excellent steamer for freezer veggies. Hope that helps ! Carol",

The product does not come with a case, or with a Reminder Cable, but it has great value for the money. The product only fits the front tires rather than the rear, and the locking pin diameter is one-half inch. Prior to purchase, it is recommended that you check that your rotor is not wider than 35mm and the gap between the rotor and the object that is bolted onto the wheel is no less than 20mm and check if the brake disc dimensions are not over 7mm thick. This product should fit the 2013 Suzuki Strong Dl1000 and the 2013 Honda CBR 250R, but it is unknown if it will fit the Suzuki GNU 125 or the 2014 Yamaha FZ-09. Go to xenasecurity.com for additional dimensional information to see whether it fits your bike.",

It works better with whole beans and -- of course -- the better quality the brand of coffee, the better the taste.  If you're going to invest in a machine like this, it makes sense to buy good coffee beans. We use Dallmayr. We bought this machine for Christmas and it's more than paid for itself.  We love it!",

As for your question, it would hold up great as far as the blade is concerned, however the handle is pretty wimpy so if any part of the sword would break it would be that or where the blade connects to the handle.

      "This bed skirt alternatives includes fitted or flat sheets, curtains, box spring wraps, and rugs. These ideas serve the same function as bed skirts, hide a wooden or metallic bed frame, and create a modern look. A set has shades of red which becomes subdued against the similarly colored background. Cotton filled quilts are a good choice if you don't like to overheat in bed and prefer natural fibers. Wool quilts are suitable for all-year round warmth and the natural fibers help absorb moisture, so you won't sweat while you sleep. Although a queen bed and mattress combination will fit in a 10' x 10' room, it might feel a bit cramped. This product is ideal for guest rooms or additional bedrooms because queen beds measure 60 inches wide and 80 inches long. Find which mattress size is best for you. Learn bed sizes and dimensions for king, queen, full, twin and more to compare and find the right size mattress."

The 500 prints 1200dpi so if you have the depth of field and your software can handle, printing on a Letter size paper. The 507X contains twice as much ink but is an after market purchase, which cartridge is 507a. AC100v-240v 50/60HZ, this voltage works for the device according to the installation manual.

This item can be installed on porcelain tiles by using a ceramic drill bit and plastic anchors with stainless steel screws. This rod does not pivot. It will use a regular size shower curtain or liner and will add a little more room. There is the possibility that this item could be cut down to fit a shower pan.

The water will likely interfere with the wireless signal if it is submerged, though.  Probably will make the device very hard to use, unless you're just talking about weather resistance for outdoor use.  As with all projects of that nature, try to give them a little protection from the brunt of the rain force, but they will handle the splash back without a problem.",

      "This product is able to resist the penetration of water to some degree but not entirely. It is also water-repellent which means it is not easily penetrated by water, especially as a result of being treated for such a purpose with a surface coating. Waterproof means that they are impervious to water. Vetco recommends, as a general rule, not to connect more than three complete strips end-to-end without adding in extra, higher gauge power wire or additional power supply units down the line. Two of the most common remote control battery types include rechargeable lithium ion and alkaline batteries. These remote control batteries are easy to charge and minimize the need for purchasing replacement batteries. One remote can control multiple receivers. You need to match the code with each receiver by using a remote controller. First, hold the ON button for 5 seconds, then LED strips light will flash which means the remote has paired with the receiver successfully. The controller will remember all your data, including watering schedules, reports, and system settings. When the controller powers back on, it will automatically reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. Light dimmers save energy by reducing the flow of electricity to the bulb and allowing lights to operate with lower power outputs. Since lights under less stress shine longer, dimmers are known to extend the life span of your bulbs."

If this is similar to the stereo receivers of the 70s-80s, you would not want to use 4 ohm rated speakers as what normally happens is the speakers get paralleled and the resistance/impedance drops to 2 ohms and that the amp would never be able to handle without shutting down. If I remember, I will test this and comment further but everything I have read says this should work with 8 ohm rated speakers.",

It's just two pairs of stereo speakers.  This is a two channel (stereo) receiver.

        "answer": "Hi. You could change USB2 to USB3 by adding a USB3 card to your Windows Machine if there is a slot for it. However, you can not just \"change USB2 to USB3. Hello, USB3 is back compatible with USB2.  But, you can use an external USB3 drive like this one, using your existing USB2 port. Keep in mind that it will run with USB2 speed and you might also get a message about connecting to a faster port, but it will work.",

When I switched out my SONY amp for a DENON amp-the difference was astounding,needless to say immediately noticeable. It was like these speakers were given a new life.",

      "The case comes with heatsink gel already applied. Your ability to run high quality games will depend on memory and video cards more than the processor alone. This chip like all other chips will run ddr2 memory as long as it has an AM2/AM2+/AM3 CPU while ddr3 will only work by using AM3/AM3+ CPU. You should look online for more about the specifications for each cpu and motherboard as it can be a complex topic. This processor would need an AM3+ motherboard to work properly with the biostar otherwise you will run into issues with performance. A socket am3 cpu can be paired with an am3+ motherboard but the reverse won't work. This product comes with a fan to help with cooling."

The pewter is a semi glass texture. Toys can be hung from a hanger or a latch. The seed guards are screwed into place. As long as the bird is getting physical exercise outside of the cage, the cage works well for Blue-and-Gold Macaws.

The mirror also has suction cups to place the mirror of vertical surface but is stationary (no tilting) when it that position. The light is very bright and mirror itself is great for putting on makeup, especially in cruise ship cabins and hotel rooms which have absolutely no light or mirrors that are not easily used. Great for traveling!!",

I dont know if it breaks easy though. I wrote absolutely stuning because of the paint and looks. If you dont find an answer, ask the other reviewers, i hope this helps, even if its a little bit. If you still dont find an answer, ill be ordering it but not until the end of the month. Maybe try looking up the figure on youtube. Watch a couple of reviews, just so you can build your confidence on this figure.",

Certain manufacturers sell paper for \"paint\" sanding that is more resistant to clogging and theoretically should last longer. If your goal is to just sand bare wood, start with a course grit i.e.. 80 and then use progressively higher numbers until you get the desired smoothness.",

      "This item comes as pictured. The four tubes all together hold about eighty-eight brasses and can also be used by sliding bullets into position. On the pistol caliber, the dies are carbide and do not lube. The seating die will crimp the brass depending on how high or low you have it set. You can change out the dies to load different calibers, and if you change the die, you can reload 30-06 with this press. This product comes with a .40 die which is the same as 10mm. If it is a large pistol primer, this is not a setup for 10mm. It has a small pistol primer set up for .40. You will need to purchase the die set for the .223 Remington along with a shell plate that holds the brass."

Now the Tamron converter will work with all lenses and I have found it works great.  Testing both lenses, autofocus is slower on the converters equally and you loose two F stops.  Nikon's website has the manual for the converter or you can google it as a PDF file to see the lenses it works with.",

I use the TC-20E III with the D7000 and the AF-S Nikkor 300mm f/4D IF-ED lens and get excellent results on bright sunny days.

This product can be used for children or people who are 4'10 without a problem. This product has a face opening that is wide enough to read through and is comfortable enough to sit in but it hasn't been tested for more than an hour at a time. You can adjust the height of this product easily for different clients by turning the knob and sliding some other connected parts. This product will work for someone who is 6 feet tall."

    "summary": [
      "The product is set in ancient times but there's nothing like magic or supernatural premises included with the game. While the product does have some history about the 7 wonders, it's not considered educational. The game uses the seven wonders of the ancient world. They are the Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Garden of Babylon, Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. This is an interactive play where men and women are dressed appropriately and an average of 8 to 10  will be fine playing this game. The game takes around 30 minutes depending on who you are playing with and how will it take to make choices. You may be able to tally the scores at the end of your head if you wish since its not necessary to write in the game. For this product, you may want to try these ideal sleeves for the cards by Ultra Pro at (http://amzn.com/B005CM80X0). Mayday sleeves are much thinner, stick to one another, and split easily when shuffling while you won't experience these issues with Ultra Pro. The downside of  Ultra Pro is that the cards don't fit perfectly and it can be a bit tight. The game's instructions can be downloaded at  http://rprod.com/index.php?. There is a video on youtube if you want an outside source, it is entitled \"7 Wonders Demo - BoardGameGeek Booth - Essen Spiel 2010.\" It will help you understand the rules of the game better."

Screw into the holes on the back to keep the back cover from sliding. The support bar in the back of the chair basically becomes a handle to carry it. Be sure to use the 2 little screws to fasten the cloth portion of the chair to the frame. There is a folding hook under the chair. The back is very supportive and stable even without using the hook. This is the wide version of the embroidered stadium seat. The hook attaches to the bleachers."

The heating elements themselves do not move closer to the bread/bagels, there are so-called 'clamps' that once the bread is lowered into the toaster, it will close/lock in the bread, from both sides to hold the bread in the middle of the heating elements so that the bread does not lean to one side or the other.  It then releases when toasting is complete and rises to the top.  Personally I think this helps to toast evenly on both sides.",

Bread toasts in less than 3 minutes on the medium setting but that depends on the level of darkness but it's pretty quick.  It also has a feature that lets you check the progress. The heating elements remain on the 2 inside and outside walls. The metal closes in on whatever bread thickness you pick. You can't turn the beep off but it's just one beep. The beep can be muted on more recent versions of the BTA820XL and BTA840XL and it can be muted from low to high. After 7 months of light use, the toasters elements will be burned. If you return the product they will send you a new one without charge."

You can also change it to run on 220 (single phase) from the delivered configuration of 110V. This item has one plastic knob and the product is interchangeable with different voltages. The belt goes down to the table and when sharpening big tools you must use caution. This product does not have a good way of holding the correct angle on the tool when sharpening tools so you will need to free hand it if you don't need a perfect angle.",
      "This product is 20\" wide and 20 \"deep, but there is an extra 4\" on the back for the faucet, soap, drain plug, etc. The plastic is about 1/2\" thick and is a 1 piece thermoplastic leak-proof tub with a 19 gallon capacity. There are three holes and 4 on the center which make this a laundry sink. On the top ledge the faucet goes there with a \"soap\" holder on each side of the faucet. As far as the unit itself, there is no reason it can't be used outside. The legs are not very strong but depending on where in the U.S. you live, there shouldn't be a problem."

This item does not fit the SodaStream 1 Liter bottles although its contents can be poured into the SodaStream bottles. If this product is compared to the Soda Stream Fountain Jet Home Soda Maker Starter Kit, it comes out much less expensive and also smaller. It is cost-efficient to throw this product out and buy brand new ones which are not true of the Soda Stream. They last forever and cost just pennies per liter. All kinds of flavored syrups like natural lemon juice can be added to the bottle to make sodas. Anything that can have bubbles blown through it works just fine. Some liquids cannot be fully carbonated. As shown on youtube, juices are too thick unless they are watered down and wines do work, but only about half a bottle because of all the fizz it creates. They are not recommended for these reasons. Each CO2 cartridge lasts for one bottle. One hundred cartridges sell for about $35."

So it depends - do you have just a sink front without side walls? Then maybe you can squeeze it in, but would have trouble getting the clips in place, if you need those. If you have a 24\" sink cabinet with 1/2 or 3/4 inch plywood box construction, then definitely not. A drop in style sink might give you a little more wiggle room.",

The corners are curved to fit the Krauss sink precisely. The corners are all generously curved so if you are looking to fit something specific in there you will have to allow for that."

This product works with TMobile up to 3G network connection. This product works on 900 band on 3G but the product description proves it may not be the same one rated for the GSM Arena. This product is the model D910A, but there are multiple models sold that can be found on the GSM Arena website. The purchase of this product includes a USB cord, wall charger, and an animated cover."

You can fully immerse it underwater and it works great as the case doesn't leak. A reset button is located under the camera. To push it you might need a needle.",

The long extended cable  is for relocation of the body and the short one is for radio when unitized. The radio uses standard USB type A for plugging to the computer and the radio accepts a usb mini type plug for connections. The current radio build version (TH-9800) lacks support for programming with CHIRP 4.1. However, the upcoming beta update for CHIRP is 4.2 will probably provide support for TH-9800. The radio only supports an FM of range 26-33MHz. The radio comes with a case on the upper side a speaker mounted on top. The radio is a quad-band of 11 meters (CB) with AM and SSB. The CB European FM mode is PMR446 (70 cm HAM band for Canada and US frequencies), and has a max of 500 MW.

In that case, you can just easily plug in this cable and the screen will pop up on your TV. Easy as that. If the laptop has some other monitor connection such as DVI, then you would need a separate HDMI adapter to use this cable. As for the S4, you will definitely need an HDMI adapter to use these cables with it. Samsung makes one that you can buy separately, but I'm sure there are plenty of knock offs out there.

This isn't Molle compatible but there are holes that allow you to lash it into a vest or backpack. It's a durable knife but it isn't an axe or machete. It is shipped in a typical brown box.",

Don't fold over the tent fabric because it could weaken so just stuff into stuff sack that is dry to allow very little air flow to prevent mildew. It comes with 8 stakes and 4 strings for the corners. This product will work well in strong wind and rain. This product can't handle a heavy light but a flashlight will be fine. This product comes with a rain fly. Keep in mind that if you include possessions only 3 people can fit comfortably."

The back of this product has a loop for a belt to go through. This product is made in China but is very good quality and the canteen is made of plastic but the cooing cup is made of aluminum. The product becomes discolored when used near a campfire and will not get better because campfires are tough on camp gear and plastic."

        "answer": "On my 2005 Silverado, the connector box is under the left side of steering wheel and against the firewall (between brake pad and emergency brake lever).  I cannot say for sure that the Excalade is identical.  It has a plastic screw in center and push connectors on the sides of the cover.  With cover removed, the plugin just plugs to the top row of connectors second from the left.  Then just tuck the wiring out of the way under the dash (plastic electrical ties) and mount the brake controller on the bottom of the dash with provided bracket.  Done.",

The unit has sufficient power to make many of the Vitamix recipes with no problem. I feel that the unit performs as well as its more expensive, higher priced cousin. I believe the Vitamix has a lifetime warranty. I would rather save the few hundred dollars and get similar results utilizing the HeathMaster Elite.",

      "iPad mini is beloved for its size and capability. And now there are even more reasons to love it. The A12 Bionic chip with Neural Engine. A 7.9inch Retina display with True Tone. Insta360 One R is a modular 360 camera that can be converted into other. When used with a dive case, it can be used up to 60 meters. Just gently pop off the two corner holds by where the front cover hinges, then slide the iPad out of the middle fingers towards the front lap. There is a spine along the side with the smart connector that can be removed, leaving a perfect opening for a Smart Cover or Smart Keyboard. The spine is removable which allows easy attachment for Smart Cover or Keyboard. With this new Google Photos update, you can now add portrait mode to any photo. Most recent iPhones and Androids have portrait mode, which blurs the background and focuses on the subject, making the photo looks like it was taken with a high-end DSLR camera. It is not possible for the Ipad to stand vertically with this case because of its long sides. Good quality leather always has quality stitching to match. Flaws in stitching, hardware, and lining can indicate inferior leather quality. Pay close attention to how it feels and looks, if it feels wrong it probably is. To look for your device model number, just open settings and tap about. You can find the model number in the top section. If the number you see contains a slash \"/\" that's the part number, just tap the part number to reveal the model number, which contailns letters followed by four number and no slash.",

Nonetheless, usually when working with this type of setup you must find a good balance between input volume (the one set at the input device) and output volume (the one set at the amp) in order to avoid distortion of the sound (if input volume is very high it will cause distortion) and also achieve a good output volume without forcing the amp (output volume too high) which by the way can also cause distortion of the sound.

The answer to your question is: The working volume of your sound IS controlled by the source. (PC, etc.) The control on the amp will allow you to fine-tune the over-all loudness of your source.

Because the keyboard is easily removable, you are able to manipulate the case any way you want it for your own comfort. The keyboard is held in place with magnets which also means you can move the keyboard to any place on the case, which allows more comfortable angles for the tablet while you are typing.",

      "Philips LED bulbs with a warm glow dimming effect, dim just like traditional incandescent bulbs. They get warmer in tone as the light gets dim. Rotations may be clockwise or counterclockwise. Other LED bulbs simply get less bright, without the cozy glow. To control a remote-controlled ceiling fan without using the remote, add a pull cord to the pull switch on the motor module. The pull cord can be purchased from a hardware store or garden and patio shop, while the tools needed are already in most households. You may need a light kit to install your fan. If you do not need a light kit, a switch housing cap will be inside the original Hunter box. Ceiling fans should be installed, or mounted, in the middle of the room and at least 7 feet above the floor and 18 inches from the walls. If ceiling height allows, install the fan 8 - 9 feet above the floor for optimal airflow. Most standard mount fans that hang from a down rod will put the blades about 12\" from the ceiling making them appropriate for rooms with ceilings that are 8 feet or higher. Flush mount fans are designed for rooms with low ceilings that are less than 8 feet. The generally accepted rule for hanging dining room chandeliers is that the bottom of the fixture should hang between 30 and 36 inches above the top of the dining table. This range assumes you have an 8-foot ceiling."

The rings are large enough to make a normal size English muffin. Pour the scrambled egg mixture into these rings, fold the handles down and put a lid on. Then the egg will be fully cooked. One egg can fit in the ring. If two eggs are put in, they will run out the edge and get outside the ring if the pan temperature is not high when the first egg is put in. Sometimes it will not cook well. The temperature has to be just right and it can be challenging to do two eggs in the ring. The rings are microwave unsafe because  the handles are metal. The product comes with two piece set. They are dishwasher safe and they always clean up well.  As with all silicone items, nothing really sticks so cleanup is very easy regardless of method."

Each section on the display box has a width of 2.3\" and is 3.9\" long. There shouldn't be an issue with putting large men's watches inside the display box. It is capable of fitting small and larger face watches inside of it. While the product is capable of fitting women's watches, it's design is more suitable for men's watches. The display box is designed so that the dividers aren't able to be removed. However, the cushion forms that hold the watches are fully removable. This watch display box would most likely be able to hold pocket watches. The only catch  is you might have to remove the pillow or put the pocket watch under it. The product is the same dark brown color that is displayed in the picture. This makes it a great addition to any room. Each section of the display box is about 1 and a half inches wide. Some of today's huge watches can't be used with it."

      "This product does not have a compressor, it is a thermoelectric cooler hose that needs to be plugged into the car or using an inside outlet, as this product has an AC adaptor.  Most cars have power flowing to the cigarette lighter. A one hundred Ah battery will last up to 20 hours if the cooler draws its maximum of 5.0 amps. Watts is 5 amps at 12 volts, so using the standard formula P=EI, wattage is 60. The P65 model has a heat function that is similar to the P27, you simply have to flip over the connector to heat.Meat is kept as cool as it would if it were in a standard refrigerator. If unplugged overnight, it is recommended that you have ice packs in the cooler and a blanket on top of the lid for insulation, and your food will stay cold and fresh for the next day."

With the moon, you can shoot with your native 650mm focal length, unless you want a close up of a crater or mountain range, then use the 2x or 3x barlow.  I recommend Televue Powermates for best performance.",

        "answer": "The bigger the scope the better. Once you get the optimal focal ratio (f/11 for this camera) your image of Jupiter will be, in pixels, about the size of your scope, in mm. An 8\" scope (200mm) will give you a Jupiter around 200 pixels wide. Watch my YouTube video Planetary Imaging - Which Barlow? to see how I came up with that. A spotting scope has a small lens. Also, you need to have a motorized mount that will take out the Earth's rotation. See my video Planetary Imaging - Equipment Needed to learn more.",

      "This product will work with any telescope with a 1.25\" eyepiece but you would be required to refocus and re-center the object with the eyepiece. This product can work with the NexStar 130 for viewing of the Moon. It would be hard to see other planets unless you change the focal length. This product is for use with a Windows system. A Mac would need a different product than this one for ideal use. This product is threaded on both ends so that you can put them on both ends with a 1.25\" adapter compatible with any telescope that you would like to use them on. This product would work with a Windows 7 but wouldn't work with Linux. This product can be used ideally with a large telescope but with a smaller optic you would have a lot of feedback that would interfere with results. This product can be used with 2x or 3x to get higher magnification but it would be more difficult to keep centered and in focus unless you are very skilled. This product comes standard with a 1.25\" barrel that can be used with any 1.25\" eyepiece, which includes the Nexstar130 SLT without an adapter."

If the product is a replacement for a 8400 GS then the product will work. However, do note that if you're trying to run this in SLI then unfortunately it wouldn't work as it doesn't have the SLI capability. Unfortunately, the product will not work with the HP Pavilion G7-2223 as it is a Notebook PC and will only work on desktop versions. The product will work with a dual monitor setup that you can set through the NVIDIA control panel. The graphic card is compatible with a regular HDMI cable though it wouldn't work with a mini HDMI. Check the manufacturer website to ensure that it is compatible. The product is about the same speed as the GT430. The 9500 GT set up with the DDR2 MEM is slightly slower."

The key here is to ensure the adapter you pick can transmit on the same protocols as your router. If you have an 802.11ac, for instance, you'll want an 802.11ac wireless adapter. 802.11n or 802.11ac is usually recommended for users shopping for both the router and the adapter, to ensure fast and reliable connectivity. Available with Windows 10 Pro  for a smooth, versatile PC experience. Windows 11 will be coming later this year. After installing Windows 7, you may need to download the latest Windows 7 drivers for some of the hardware in your PC. As of January 2020, Microsoft is no longer supporting Windows 7and Windows XP is a 15+ years old operating system and is not recommended to be used mainstream in 2020 because the OS has security issues and any attacker can take advantage of a vulnerable OS. . We recommend upgrading to Windows 10 to continue receiving security updates and technical support. As the day wears on you will doubtless spend even more time browsing online, uploading images, playing music and streaming video. If the speed of your internet connection to your Wi-Fi gateway isn't consistent you can check it with AT&T Smart Home Manager."
